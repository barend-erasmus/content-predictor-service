Coffee gets new high,Procter & Gamble (P&G) have announced a 14% rise in the retail price of its Folger roast-and-ground coffee brand.,"<p>Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) have announced a 14% rise in the retail price of its Folger roast-and-ground coffee brand.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>P&G’s price increase, the first for two years, has been forced upon them by the recent steep rise in the commodity price of coffee beans caused by poor crop yields and increased global demand.</p>
<h4>Bean rise</h4>
<p>The commodity price of coffee has been rising gradually for the past two years. In January 2002, the average global price for beans was just over US$0.43 per lb (US$0.95 per kg), compared to just under US$0.59 per lb (US$1.30 per kg) in January 2004. Prices have been rising as coffee-exporting countries have restricted production to increase prices to more economic levels and as farmers give up farming coffee due it not being economically viable.</p>
<p>Prices have risen at a faster rate in 2004. In November, the composite price had risen to US$0.68 per lb (US$1.50 per kg). Heavy rain in two of the largest coffee growing companies Brazil, and Colombia has damaged the crops, reducing estimated production for 2003-04 by over 15% on the previous season to just under 6.1 billion tonnes.</p>
<p>This is combined with the simultaneous rise in retail volume consumption, up by nearly 2% to over 3.6 billion tonnes in 2004. Volume growth is being driven by the rapid growth in non-traditional coffee drinking countries as new consumers pick up the habit. In 2004, Eastern Europe grew by 4% and Asia Pacific by 5%.</p>
<h4>Prices to get higher</h4>
<p>Retail prices will carry on rising in the short to medium term. This is partly due to general trends mentioned above regarding restricting exports and declining areas of production. </p>
<p>The shortage of coffee beans will be exacerbated in the short term by much weaker production in Brazil, with yields down by as much of 25%. Part of the decline is expected as coffee plants have a biennial production cycle, with one good year (2003-04) followed by a poor growing season (2004-05). Yields will be reduced further as many Brazilian farmers have reduced the amount of fertiliser they put on their crops. Fertiliser prices have risen this year, on a par with the cost of the major ingredient, crude oil.</p>
<p>The further decline in production, combined with a 10% medium term growth in global retail volume consumption, will further drive price increases. Dynamic consumption growth in immature markets such as Eastern Europe (20%) and Asia Pacific (26%), will be tempered if prices rise too much; countries, such as China, where price is a key factor in determining demand are the most likely to suffer.</p>",436,1,0,2006-11-14 15:45:38,30619,39,2004-12-10 00:00:00,IWArticle
Australian growers to sell coffee crop at home,The growers at Northern Rivers Coffee Projects introduce premium beans to the Australian market.,"<p>The growers at Northern Rivers Coffee Projects introduce premium beans to the Australian market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The Northern Rivers Coffee Projects, an Australian-based coffee plantation, generally exports its coffee beans to the US. However, with the growing demand for premium coffee in Australia, the company held back part of its 2004 yield in order to supply Australian consumers. The market for coffee is growing in Australia, and most of what is consumed is imported.</p>
<h4>Growth in café culture</h4>
<p>Increasingly affluent Australian consumers recently adopted café culture, which gave them a taste for café-quality coffee. Young people especially have begun congregating at coffee outlets such as Starbucks, Michelle’s and Gloria Jeans. In 2003, there were an estimated 482 franchised café chain outlets in Australia. The total number of cafés in Australia could total 10 to 30 times that number, if independently owned cafés that are commonly found in Australian suburbs are counted.</p>
<p>Consumers are now trying to replicate the café coffee experience at home, using coffee grinders and other coffee-making equipment that are relatively new to the Australian market and therefore expensive. Volume sales of fresh coffee beans grew 44%, while value sales grew 71% to A$13 million (US$8 million). Fresh coffee beans still constitutes only 4% of total coffee volume, but it is expected to see 25% value growth in the medium term, while instant coffee is projected to grow only 5%.</p>
<h4>Shifting away from instant</h4>
<p>Until recently, Australians tended to drink instant coffee consuming 14.5 billion tonnes of it in 2003, versus only 4.6 billion tonnes of fresh coffee. The drop in interest in instant coffee is offset somewhat by sales of premium brands of instant coffee such as Nestlé’s Nescafé Gold.</p>
<p>Fresh coffee was once only available through locally owned delicatessens and specialised shops, but is increasingly available through supermarkets and hypermarkets. However, volume growth of fresh coffee has grown between 5-7% a year since 1997, while sales of instant coffee have stagnated.</p>
<h4>Slowdown in US market</h4>
<p>The Northern Rivers Coffee Projects sells the bulk of its harvest in the US. While the US market is still an important one for Australia’s growers, the domestic market offers far stronger possibilities for growth. US consumers drink more than twice the amount of coffee per capita as Australian consumers, up to almost 647 billion tonnes in 2003. Yet the market for fresh coffee is mature, and is forecast to see a little over 7% volume growth in the medium term. Volume growth declined 2% in 2003, after seeing value growth of 5% a year between 1997 and 2003.</p>",178379,1,157,2005-03-30 21:42:35,32939,39,2005-03-30 00:00:00,IWArticle
Burger King joins coffee craze,The fast food giant is testing premium coffee for a US roll out. ,"<p>The fast food giant is testing premium coffee for a US roll out. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The world's second largest fast food burger chain, Burger King, has confirmed that it is test marketing a premium coffee, called BK Joe, for a nationwide roll out in the US. The test follows other fast food chains, replacing standard coffee products with premium roasted beans, as a strategy to boost sales.</p>
<p>Burger King forecasts a US$80 million increase in sales on the back of the successful launch of the premium coffee product. The chain's test follows its main competitor, McDonald's Corp, which has already introduced it a premium coffee in test markets and expects a national launch later this year. Both Burger King and McDonald's trail other fast food and speciality coffee chains, such as Starbucks Corp, which dominate the market for high-end coffee.</p>
<h3>Starbucks is light years ahead</h3>
<p>As the leader in premium coffee, Starbucks' sales in the US reached US$3.4 billion in 2003, nearly half of the country's US$7 billion speciality coffee market. However, the combined premium coffee sales of speciality chains and fast food chains, such as Dunkin' Donuts was in excess of US$11 billion in 2003.</p>
<p>US consumers treat themselves regularly to premium coffee. Dunkin' Donuts derived roughly 60% of its US$2.8 billion in total sales from premium coffee in 2003. It offers a premium coffee that is 15-25% below the price of Starbucks. A Wendy's restaurant subsidiary, Tim Horton's, offers premium coffee below that cost of Dunkin' Donuts.</p>
<p>The move by foodservice outlets to meet consumer demand, has further popularised premium coffee. Volume sales of premium coffee through foodservice channels have hit record levels, reflecting the growing trend of US consumers to purchase food and drink 'on the go'. The number of American adults drinking coffee has nearly doubled in the past four years.</p>
<h3>Coffee targets BK's existing customers</h3>
<p>The delayed entry by Burger King may present difficulties for the expansion of its coffee business, especially in larger cities where premium coffee is widely available. In these cities and the surrounding suburban locations, many consumers have already developed a taste for, and a loyalty to, a brand of premium coffee.</p>
<p>As such, BK Joe is most likely to improve Burger King's sales with existing customers and strengthen customer loyalty, not lure new customers from other chains. In such a competitive market, it is just as important to keep its customers from going elsewhere just for a cup of coffee.</p>",1461,2,158,2009-10-09 22:07:09,34146,39,2005-04-27 00:00:00,IWArticle
Starbucks to perk up with Asia-Pacific RTD coffee launches,Production agreements with local partners in Japan and Taiwan means Starbucks can offer RTD coffee products under its name.,"<p>Production agreements with local partners in Japan and Taiwan means Starbucks can offer RTD coffee products under its name.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Following the launch of Starbucks branded coffee liqueur in the US, the company is continuing to look for other revenue streams and become less reliant on its foodservice outlets, by moving into Asia-Pacific RTD coffee. </p>
<p>Japan is the default choice for any company looking to launch a RTD coffee product in Asia-Pacific. The Japanese are the third biggest consumers of coffee in the world and by far the biggest consumers of RTD coffee in the region with volume sales of just under 2.8 billion litres in 2004. It also has the highest concentration of Starbucks outlets, with 534 at the start of October 2004. </p>
<p>Taiwan is the third biggest country in the region in terms of Starbucks outlets and RTD coffee sales. In October 2004, it had 136 outlets, 16 less than China and volume sales of RTD coffee of around 140 million litres in 2004, 19 million less than South Korea. Its relatively small population of just under 23 million makes it, behind Japan, the second best potential market.</p>
<h3>Maybe not so perky </h3>
<p>Despite the benefits of both countries, the Starbucks brand will struggle to make impact in both. Both countries' RTD coffee volume sales will mature with Japan growing by less than 4% and Taiwan by just over 5%. In addition, both of Starbucks' local partners are distant seconds behind their immediate sector competition and lack the major distribution networks to make an impact. In Japan, Suntory had around a 12% share in 2004 behind Coca-Cola's 41%. In Taiwan, Uni-President's 16% share was 33% behind the leader King Car Foods. If it does succeed it will be as a premium niche product, such as in Japan targeting young women whom enjoy frequenting coffee shops.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-15 10:48:48,35364,39,2005-06-02 00:00:00,IWArticle
Instant coffee excites Latin America,"Latin America is experiencing growing popularity of instant coffee, which appeals to young consumers as a lifestlye drink.

","<p>Latin America is experiencing growing popularity of instant coffee, which appeals to young consumers as a lifestlye drink. Nestle continues to rule this promising coffee market. Hope Lee, non-alcoholic drinks analyst, reports on the latest coffee consumption trend in Latin America. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p></p>
<p>Latin America is the largest producer of coffee in the world. The combined production of coffee in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia accounted for 44% of the world's production in 2003. In these nations, coffee is an intrinsic part of the local culture. In terms of consumption level, Latin America stood at a total consumption of 1.6 kg per head in 2004, which is 45% more than that in Eastern Europe but still only half of what is consumed per capita in Western Europe. The high consumption levels in Western Europe are underpinned by the rooted coffee drinking habits, especially in the northern part of the region. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Traditionally, the Latin American coffee market is dominated by fresh ground coffee. Interest was however aroused by the reports of Nestlé's outstanding value sales of instant coffee in Latin America in the first half of 2004. Among major Latin American countries, Brazil and Colombia saw particularly strong growth in retail volume sales of instant coffee between 1997 and 2004. </p>
<h3>Mixed product composition in different countries</h3>
<p>With total volume sales at 873,429 tonnes in 2004, coffee is the most popular hot drink in Latin America, accounting for the bulk of hot drinks volume and value sales in most countries. However, sales of coffee are highly susceptible to macro-economic performances in the region. The fluctuation of local currencies and the price change in commodity coffee all had effects on coffee sales in Latin America. In Argentina, for example, total volume sales of coffee showed a sharp decline of 12% in the period of 2001-2002 due to the poor macro economic conditions. </p>
<p>In terms of product composition, Latin American coffee is highly fragmented. Generally speaking, fresh ground coffee is the most popular format in overall coffee, with per capita retail consumption at an estimated 1.6kg per head in 2004. However, the level of importance of fresh ground coffee varies from country to country. Fresh ground is the dominant format in both volume and value terms in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela but equally overwhelming is the dominance of instant coffee in Mexico and Chile. Argentina is also a traditionally large consumer of fresh ground coffee but instant coffee accounted for 53% of retail value sales and 23% retail volume sales in the country in 2004. The higher unit price of instant coffee means it takes the bulk of value share in Argentina. </p>

<h3>Fresh ground benefits from convenience </h3>
<p>While fresh beans are either a negligible or, in the case of Mexico, a non-existent product in Latin America, retail volume sales of fresh coffee reached 712,000 tonnes in Latin America in 2004, with sales essentially coming from fresh ground coffee. </p>
<p>The negligible presence of fresh beans is partly due to the lack of grinding machines in Latin American households. The process of preparing fresh coffee via paper or fabric filters is less expensive and is a more convenient alternative to fresh beans. Moreover, energy shortages in the region do little to boost sales of grinding machines or indeed of electric coffee filter machines. Coffee grinding machines are also expensive to buy and run and for price-sensitive consumers fresh ground coffee seems more economical than coffee beans. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there were more marketing activities for fresh ground coffee than for coffee beans in recent years and the development of premium fresh gourmet coffee provided a boost to the sales of fresh ground coffee.</p>

<h3>Instant coffee brews aroma </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Although the sales of instant coffee are relatively small within the overall coffee sales in Latin America, instant coffee has a great potential for growth over the next few years. Convenience is the key factor that supported the growing popularity of instant coffee over the past few years. All countries bar Argentina recorded positive growth in retail volume sales of instant coffee between 1997 and 2004. Industry experts commented that the economic difficulty adversely affected the volume sales of instant coffee in Argentina during the period. </p>
<p>In Brazil, the growing trend towards convenience products is keenly seen in younger consumers. These younger consumers are being targeted by major manufacturers through carefully tailored advertising campaigns and promotions. Manufacturers in Brazil also offer a growing range of added-value instant coffee containing new flavours and combination blends. Néscafé Cappuccino Moka (French Vanilla flavour) is readily available in major cities in Brazil already. So far, manufacturers' hard work in Brazil proved fruitful. This is reflected in the boom in instant coffee sales in Brazil, a country that is not traditionally valuable in terms of instant coffee sales. Changes in the demographic context such as the increase in the number of single consumer households also helped to drive sales of instant coffee in Brazil. </p>
<p>Colombia is also experiencing rapid development in instant coffee. However, the consumer profile in Colombia depicts a different picture compared with that in Brazil. In Colombia, instant coffee's appeal is especially strong among wealthier consumers, as the product remains out of reach of low-income consumers. The price of an average instant coffee brand is normally three to four times higher than a fresh ground variant. Higher-income young city workers, increasingly living alone, are also attracted to instant coffee. Most new product developments in Colombia in recent years were in instant coffee. Local companies such as Cía Nacional de Chocolate and Colcafé SA are actively launching their own instant coffee variants. Cía Nacional de Chocolate, the second largest instant coffee player in Colombia, launched Colcafé Crioconcentrado, Colcafé Neutralizado and Colcafé Liofilizado in recent years. </p>
<p>Mexico has relatively strongly developed instant coffee sales compared with its Latin American counterparts. In Mexico, convenience factors such as single-serve sachets and added-value offerings such as flavours are also driving instant coffee sales. Speciality coffees were also introduced in an attempt to entice Mexican consumers. Nestlé extended the Nescafé line into speciality coffee with variants including cappuccino and mocha and with flavoured coffee such as French vanilla recently. Mexico was a high margin and high growth country for Nestlé, where the company saw its retail value sales grow at 23% between 2000 and 2004. </p>
<p>Instant speciality coffee became more widely spread and available over the review period and is likely to continue attracting attention from both manufacturers and young consumers over the forecast period. Speciality coffee can drive value growth and possibly increase the margin of sales. Young consumers appear to be responsive to speciality offerings and this is encouraging for manufacturers who intend to create further demand for this niche. However, the majority of consumers in Latin America are still quite conservative towards instant speciality coffee. Speciality coffees in Argentina, for example, are only sold in upscale on-trade establishments. It could be a long haul for speciality coffee to fully take off in retail stores in Argentina. </p>

<h3>Nestlé rules</h3>
<p>Multinationals held the largest shares both in volume and value terms in Latin American coffee in 2004. Nestlé accounts for over 27% of retail value sales of coffee in Latin America, with Sara Lee far behind. Nestlé's strong position is firmly underpinned by its Nescafé brand, which has an overwhelmingly dominant position in instant coffee in all Latin American countries. New product development also played a pivotal role in the company's success. In the first half of 2004, Nestlé reported outstanding growth in sales of instant coffee in Latin America, suggesting there is still room for growth in instant coffee sales. </p>
<p>Nestlé is taking advantage of the changes in consumer lifestyles in Latin America and the increasing westernisation of the large young consumer group. Nescafé is marketed as a lifestyle drink and targeted at the affluent and the young. The relatively high price of instant coffee in the region also serves to push up Nestlé's retail value share and product re-launches help Nestlé to retain consumer interest. In 2003, Nestlé modified the formula for Nescafé Original and re-launched the brand in the region. </p>
<p>To illustrate Nestlé's recent marketing activities, Nestlé Brazil ran a promotion between April and December 2003 where they gave away 248 houses, with a total value of R$40 million (US$14 million). In order to participate, Brazilian consumers sent labels from eight different Nestlé products and answered the following question: ""which leading packaged food company gives you houses and helps Brazil?”. This campaign generated massive interest from consumers from various income groups. The growing interest in instant coffee encouraged Nestlé to expand its production capacity in Latin America. In mid-2004, Nestlé opened its second plant for instant coffee production in Brazil. </p>
<p>While Nestlé is busy defending and consolidating its shares, some other players are introducing gourmet coffee. Behaving like consumers in more developed countries, Latin American consumers demonstrated a growing desire for premium coffee. From a manufacturer's perspective, the introduction of higher value products can possibly help to widen profit margins. Ground gourmet coffee brand launches included Café do Ponto Aralto from Sara Lee in the first half of 2002 in Brazil. Café do Ponto Aralto is available in two different versions, 'Traditional' and 'Organic'. In 2003, Sara Lee introduced new premium fresh ground coffee called Pilão in Brazil. </p>
<h3>Starbucks touches down </h3>
<p>The global coffee house trend is emerging in Latin America. According to Euromonitor International, the total number of chained café/bars amounted to 2,647 in Latin America in 2004, an increase of 75% over 1999. The coffee house boom spurred sales of coffee through foodservice channels, and this is reflected in over 40% growth of volume sales through foodservice outlets in for instance Brazil, Colombia and Mexico between 1997 and 2004. These strong performances are attributable to growing disposable incomes in some countries such as Brazil and to the spreading influence of American culture, especially among younger consumers. </p>
<p>Starbucks is the leading representative of the chained coffee concept and the company is showing its ambitions and confidence towards Latin America. Starbucks boasts about 32 outlets in Mexico in 2004 and plans to reach 150 outlets in Mexico within five years. The company also opened six stores in the major metropolitan areas of Puerto Rico, and three stores in Peru. Starbucks' gradual penetration in the region is likely to help young consumers learn the concept of speciality coffee, premium coffee beans and flavoured coffee. In the medium-term, foodservice sales are therefore likely to facilitate retail sales of coffee, as consumers will then also be keen to bring their cafe experience home. This is an ongoing trend that is happening in several countries such as Japan and the UK. </p>
<h3>Ripples in the cup </h3>
<p>Euromonitor International's findings show that there is a strong positive long-term growth trend in the region and forecasts that total volume sales of coffee in Latin America will reach over one million tonnes by 2009, with sales growing at around 21% between 2004 and 2009. This is a much stronger growth than that predicted for developed regions such as Western Europe (3%) and North America (10%). </p>
<p>However, Latin American coffee is still emerging and while investments in the region may possibly lead to long-term financial returns, the volatility of the economies still poses a risk. There is also a risk for reduced margins due to the global trend towards coffee mixtures with added milk powder and sugar. These mixes proved popular among younger consumers in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela and are expected to penetrate the Latin American region further over the forecast period. </p>
<p>The emergence of functional instant coffee as found in Asia (instant coffee with added ginseng) and Eastern Europe (instant coffee with added vitamins and minerals) may also spread to Latin America in years to come, as the number of health-conscious consumers is rising. Eventually, functional instant coffees are likely to contribute to improve profit margins when Latin American consumers combine their coffee rituals with a healthy intake of vitamins and/or minerals or plant extracts.</p>

Kraft’s coffee goes domestic in the Ukraine,Kraft Foods is looking to exploit the booming Ukrainian coffee sector by opening up its first production facility in the country.,"<p>Kraft Foods is looking to exploit the booming Ukrainian coffee sector by opening up its first production facility in the country.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The new facility in the Kiev region, the coffee drinking heartland of the Ukraine, will allow Kraft Foods to better react to market conditions, having previously imported the products. This should allow Kraft Foods to better challenge the leading manufacturer, Nestlé.</p>
<h3>Small and fast</h3>
<p>Coffee grew by over 15% in value terms to nearly Hr1.4 billion (US$277 million) in 2004, with volume up nearly 10% to 19,000 tonnes. The rapid growth is from a low base, but as disposable income rises, so does the outlook for the coffee market.</p>
<p>Kraft Foods' site in the centre of the country is strategically well-positioned for easy distribution nationwide. The move will allow the company to better exploit the strong value growth predicted in the Ukrainian market to the mid to longer term. In value terms, Kraft Foods has a lot of work to catch up to market leader Nestlé. This gap should become markedly smaller with the opening of the new production site but is unlikely to result in Kraft Foods overtaking its rival in the short to medium term.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-20 15:59:26,37108,39,2005-08-29 00:00:00,IWArticle
Gaggia to add to premium push in UK coffee,Gaggia is attempting to exploit its range of premium coffee machines by launching a premium coffee in the UK.,"<p>Gaggia is attempting to exploit its range of premium coffee machines by launching a premium coffee in the UK.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Sales of coffee machines grew by over 130% to over 1 million units between 2000 and 2004 but grow is levelling off. UK fresh coffee sales grew by 4% in 2004 to reach £120 million (US$214 million) as consumers continued to trade up from the traditionally consumed instant variants to more premium fresh coffee. </p>
<p>Gaggia's launch, which includes both ground and filtered coffee and single serve pods, is into a growing but very competitive fresh coffee market, which is currently dominated by private label and no brand has more than 11% of value sales.</p>
<h3>Bitter taste</h3>
<p>Although fresh coffee is expected to increase at over three times the rate of the overall sector's long term growth of 6%, the Gaggia brand might struggle to make an impact. The brand does not have a high profile in the UK, with its coffee machines having negligible share of that sector. In addition, it will also face stiff competition not only from the mass brand competitors such as Douwe Egberts and Lavazza but also private label. The key to this market appears to be premium and super premium products, but this is a very market niche, which would need to be dominated to be profitable. </p>",436,1,156,2006-11-20 11:56:55,39865,39,2005-08-08 00:00:00,IWArticle
Coffee pod systems: taking on mature markets,"High prices and a modern image make coffee pod systems attractive to manufacturers seeking to maximise their revenues.

Hope Lee, Industry Analyst for Hot Drinks, reviews the development of this type of product and the likely scenario for the future.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Coffee pod systems have not only revolutionised the custom of drinking coffee but also revitalised saturated western markets. While health and wellness are the most important factors shaping product development in the soft drinks industry, innovation has been topical in the hot drinks industry in recent years. Among various innovation initiatives, the coffee pod systems are attracting the most attention from both the coffee marketers and coffee lovers.</p>
<p>The principal factor for the innovation of the coffee pod system is the saturation of western coffee markets. Indeed, the total per cap consumption of coffee in some major western markets such as Belgium (5.1 kg), Netherlands (6.8 kg), and France (3.7 kg) are high, compared to the world's average (0.7 kg) and emerging markets such as Russia (0.5 kg). There are several reasons for the saturation of the coffee market in western countries. Firstly, coffee has essentially been a staple beverage for most households for many years and some consumers have lost their interest in coffee. Secondly, in terms of share of throat, some consumers have developed a desire for diversity in choice of beverages and are migrating to soft drinks. Finally, health factors such as concern over excessive intake of caffeine also discourage the consumption.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor to drive the innovation is manufacturers' strong desire to sustain and increase the value sales of coffee in matured markets. During the past few years, the price reduction in green coffee depressed the retail price of coffee and therefore negatively affected the overall value sales of coffee, although the commodity price of green coffee recovered in 2005. Additionally, private labels in matured markets has not only posed a challenge to branded coffee but also has had a knock-on effect on value sales. This situation is reflected in the consecutive decline in retail value sales of coffee in a number of traditional coffee drinking nations such as Germany over the past few years.</p>
<p>Therefore, in search of sustainable growth in demand for coffee and boosting value sales, the main strategies for branded coffee marketers have been focused on increasing drinking occasions, attracting new consumers especially young consumers, and adding value to coffee products and coffee accessories.</p>
<h2>Smart technology makes a perfect cup</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, in terms of geographic spread, most mainstream coffee pod systems were first launched in developed markets, particularly matured coffee markets in the Western European region. Switzerland, for example, saw the first launch of Nespresso in 1986. France, was the test-bed for Kraft's Tassimo in 2004. Coffee marketers are hoping that the innovation of the coffee pod systems can help to refresh the traditional industry, generate new interests from consumers, as well as result in higher margins of coffee sales.</p>
<p>In terms of the main features of the system, most coffee pod systems have similar advantages such as ease-of-use, convenience and they are compact. The ability to produce a cup of fresh coffee at consistently high quality instantly is the key feature of the coffee pod system. As consumers live busier lifestyles, they increasingly demand convenience hot drinks, which also mirror the general food and beverage trends favouring the convenience aspect of products. The conventional way to make fresh coffee through filter machines seems time consuming and hardly suits the modern lifestyle. Apart from the lifestyle change, some young consumers are also eager to emulate their Starbucks experience at home and the coffee pod system seems able to deliver such a promise.</p>
<p>The industry is keenly enthusiastic about this relatively new concept, and believes that the marriage of the smart technology and branded coffee pods is a perfect combination of quality and convenience.</p>
<h2>Brand loyalty</h2>
<p>Major food and beverage manufacturers have adopted similar strategies to enter the portioned market and they tend to team up with appliances makers and produce their own versions of coffee pod systems. Normally, coffee players supply their own branded pods and their appliances partners design and produce the machine. Two parties hope that the marriage between the machine and the branded coffee pods can regenerate consumers' interest in coffee and loyalty to the coffee brand.</p>
<p>Sara Lee, Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, Melitta, Tchibo and Kraft are active players in the home coffee pod market. Heavy advertising spends and Internet sales are the main similarities in the marketing strategies for these mainstream players. All players are trying hard to differentiate from each other and outperform each other in order to win consumers' loyalty.</p>
<p>Kraft's proprietary Tassimo Hot Beverage, for example, is able to produce hot chocolate, tea and coffee. Tassimo consumers in multiple countries are able to use the system to brew their favourite national brands. French consumers, for instance, can enjoy their favourite coffee brand Carte Noire, Kenco in the UK, and Mastro Lorenzo in Switzerland. Industry sources commented that the functionality Tassimo offers is likely to impress consumers and win their brand loyalty. It is reported that Tassimo has achieved a great deal of success after its initial launch in France. According to Kraft's own research consumers purchase Tassimo because of the variety, convenience, quality of drinks, and innovative design offered by the system.</p>
<h2>Frothy sensation</h2>
<p>While the smart technology is the focal point of discussion in the portioned coffee industry, the main theme in the technological invention is the frothy effect these machines are able to produce. As mentioned before, the maturity of coffee consumption in western markets means that the main task for coffee marketers is to attract young consumers to stay with coffee. Research shows that young consumers are showing growing interests in the frothy sensation of coffee and frothy coffee has become a fashion in many matured coffee markets over the past five years. In fact, this phenomenon is largely in line with the global consumption trend favouring “light beverages” and the indulgence consumption pattern.</p>
<p>To this end, the technological ability to produce frothy coffee instantly is commonly used as the marketing tactics and most coffee pod systems can produce the crema effect by using the strong water pressure. The Senseo coffee pod system claims that Senseo “makes it possible to prepare a filtered cup of coffee proportioned perfectly with a delicious frothy layer on top”. Singing in a similar tune, Tchibo Cafissimo has familiar claims as follows “with its special steam nozzle, Tchibo Cafissimo produces a rich, creamy head of frothed milk in the blink of an eye for your favourite coffee specialities such as Cappuccino or Latte Macchiato”.</p>
<p>Research shows that as consumers' personal tastes for the strength of the milk or cream are varied, most pods/capsules are therefore not premixed with milk-powder, and consumers then add milk/cream afterwards. However, in the case of Tassimo, the Cappuccino pack contains servings of espresso and concentrate milk. Consumers first brew a serving (pod) of espresso in a cappuccino cup, then follow with a serving (pod) of concentrated milk. For the hot chocolate brand Suchard, milk is premixed within the capsule as part of a standard ingredient for a hot chocolate, consumers can then add extra milk/cream afterwards depending on personal taste.</p>
<p>These claims particularly appeal to consumers at age around 25-45 who are inclined to use high tech home appliances, value the modern feature and indulge the frothy taste of the hot drinks.</p>
<h2>Low wastage comes with a high price</h2>
<p>The packaging format of the single serve coffee pod is considered a revolution in the delivery of coffee. As the amount of ground coffee is portioned and either packaged in capsules or pods before brewing, the reduction of wastage is evident when comparing to the conventional preparation method of filter coffee. In the Netherlands – a traditional filter coffee drinking nation, the saying “ the sink is the biggest consumer of coffee” reflects the huge wastage of regular filter coffee in the home market. Traditionally, the Dutch consumers would measure and brew more quantity of coffee than they actually need and they end up throwing the coffee away in the sink in the end. In the Netherlands – the largest national market for Sara Lee's Senseo system by value, the growing popularity of coffee pods and the reduction of wastage of coffee have directly caused slower volume growth. However higher value growth in retail sales of coffee has been witnessed over the past three years.</p>
<p>As things stand, this strong selling point of coffee pods has generated immense consumer interest in many coffee drinking nations such as the US, France, Italy and Netherlands, where the demographic trend shows that the population is ageing and household size is becoming smaller. Consumers' lifestyles are also slowly changing following the demographic trend. Despite the fact that the average unit price of coffee pods is significantly higher than that of regular filter versions, small households and institutions are still prepared to opt for coffee pods partly due to the economical aspects of the preparation. In France, for example, prices for coffee pods are 2.5 times higher than regular filter coffee. In the US, Kraft's Maxwell House coffee pods would cost US$3.95 for 18 individual servings, while a 34.5-ounce can of Maxwell House, which makes about 240 servings, retails for about $6.99.</p>
<p>Industry sources pinpointed that consumers in western markets are increasingly affluent and they show strong desire for unique products to fit their lifestyles regardless of the price they may potentially pay. It is not coincident that most coffee pod players market their systems as a change of lifestyle and promote an upgrading image of a coffee consumption fashion.</p>
<h2>Variety boost value sales</h2>
<p>The success of coffee pods over the past couple of years is also attributable to the constantly expanding coffee varieties in the portioned coffee market. Nestlé boasts to carry a selection of 12 premium coffee blends and two rare coffee varieties for limited period every year. In 2004, Nestlé launched Lungo (lungo means long in Italian) blends to boost its CHF 600 million Nespresso business, which is around 8% of its total hot drinks business.</p>
<p>In Italy, all mainstream players include coffee pods in their product ranges, usually both standard and decaffeinated. Guarany - a pioneer in coffee pod production, plans to segment its offering further, introducing various varieties, such as Robusta, Delicata and Arabica. Also, in Italy, the emergence of ground malt hot drinks in the pod format has revitalised the stagnant malt-based hot drinks category and boost value sales in recent years. The ground malt pods are brewed in espresso machines and allow Italian consumers to indulge in a drink not too different from traditional espresso coffee. This fits some Italian consumers' concern over excessive intake of caffeine and at the same time they can enjoy an authentic fresh hot drink in a traditional fashion.</p>
<p>With an eye on the US market, Sara Lee plans to expand its coffee pod ranges in the US in a bid to defend its leadership in the coffee market. Although no specific time frame is known, it would be a surprise if the range of coffee pods in the US were   much different to those found in the Netherlands. The forthcoming initiative is likely to widen the consumer base for coffee pods when the variety of the coffee pods convinces coffee lovers to own a Senseo machine at home. JP Morgan have estimated value sales of Senseo coffee pod amounted to US$15 million in the third quarter of 2005 alone in the US and Senseo is expected to carry on its growth momentum in the last quarter of 2005 and even throughout the whole year of 2006.</p>
<p>Likewise, other players also offer variety of coffee to their consumers. Tchibo Cafissimo offers four different types of coffee – Guatemala Grande, Feine Milde, Caffè Crema and Espresso Gusto Originale. Melitta offers a wide range of coffee including 100% Arabica medium roast and Hazelnut flavoured coffee.</p>
<p>Industry sources suggested that the prospects of the coffee pods business will be underpinned by a wide variety of products and effective marketing campaigns in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Hidden bitter taste</h2>
<p>On the sales channels front, the main discussions in the portioned coffee market are essentially about the penetration of the home coffee market in recent years. As more players are entering the market, the competition for shares is heating up year-on-year. Despite the strong growth in sales, mainstream players are weary about potential threats and challenges in this new market. A few players such as Lavazza, Segafredo, Flavia (owned by Mars) who are specialised in the institutional market, could form a potential threat to home coffee marketers once they go beyond the institutional sector. The next few years will see home coffee marketers try to outperform each other in terms of coffee variety offerings, features and pricing of the machines.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the growing sales of coffee pods in institutions may facilitate retail sales as consumers get familiar with the coffee pod concept, and therefore, they may develop the desire to own one machine for at home use. In brief, most industry experts agree that the portioned coffee market is still at the fairly early stage of product development and it needs the concerted efforts from coffee marketers to exploit the market further in years to come.</p>
<p>Again, as is the case in other food and beverages category, the strong growth of private labels remains a concern for mainstream players. Private labels are squeezing in the portioned coffee market and already post a threat to Sara Lee's position in the case of the Netherlands, where supermarkets offer varieties of coffee pods which fit exactly the same technical specifications as Senseo. As private labels pods are relatively cheap, many Dutch consumers opt for private label pods instead of the expensive Douwe Egberts range. This situation has even caused a controversial lawsuit about the patent of the design for the coffee pod between Sara Lee and private label players and the verdict remains to be seen at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Industry sources commented that the emergence of private labels may force branded players to increase their expenditure in advertising and promotions in order to defend their positions. So margins could potentially be squeezed by increased advertising in the future, to ensure strong differentiation with private label products.</p>
<h2>Immediate opportunities</h2>
<p>In the short to medium term developed western markets such as Germany, France, Belgium, the US, the UK and Scandinavian countries may offer the greater potential in the short to medium terms. Firstly, the affluence levels in these markets are high enough for private households or institutions to purchase the machines and trade up to expensive coffee pods. Secondly, the demographic trends in these markets could contribute to the demand. Increasingly smaller family sizes and the hectic lifestyles will continue to help the market demand for convenience beverages. Specifically, those markets which see strong growth in sales of instant speciality coffee and also have a solid consumer base for conventional filter coffee are most likely to offer good opportunities for coffee pods as there is a reasonable consumer base for instant drinks.</p>",393,1,37,2006-11-17 14:21:01,40267,39,2005-07-20 00:00:00,IWArticle
Corporate Insight: PepsiCo wakes up and smells the coffee,PepsiCo has pre-empted Coca-Cola's coffee flavour cola launch with its own variant in a number of countries.,"<p>PepsiCo has pre-empted Coca-Cola's coffee flavour cola launch with its own variant in a number of countries.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Coca-Cola has been the first to market with new flavour variants in the past three years, including vanilla, lime and raspberry flavoured cola launches. PepsiCo's launch follow on from Coca-Cola's announcement of its plans to launch a coffee flavoured cola variant in 2006. In October 2005, PepsiCo launched its Pepsi Tarik in Malaysia, in November it will launch Pepsi Max Cappuccino in France and Belgium and in January 2006 Pepsi Max Cino in the UK. This and the company's launch of Samba, a limited edition tamarind and mango flavoured drink in Australia in August 2005 indicates PepsiCo is trying to fight back in the cola wars.</p>
<h3>Perking up taste buds </h3>
<p>Manufacturers are offering these new flavour variants to keep consumers interested in cola carbonates. Standard cola carbonates performed badly in 2004 in Western Europe, growing by just over 1% compared 3% growth for overall cola carbonates.</p>
<h3>Struggling to perk up sales? </h3>
<p>PepsiCo has already attempted a similar product when it tested marketed a coffee variant it in the US called Pepsi Kona in 1996, which failed to take off. While consumers have become more susceptible to flavour variants, this product may still struggle.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of coffee as a hot drink in Western Europe, consumers do not like the concept of drinking cold coffee. Consumption of RTD coffee is negligible in the region with Germany the only country with any substantial sales. The other problem could be that the concept of a coffee flavoured cola carbonate is that it goes against the trend of consumers preferring healthier carbonate variants. The concept of a double caffeine hit (although no extra is being added) could put off health conscious consumers.</p>
<p>PepsiCo should continue to innovate with new cola flavours to try and gain share in the highly profitable cola carbonates sector but should perhaps look for seemingly healthier and perhaps more refreshing variants such as Samba.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-28 10:42:07,42301,39,2005-10-26 00:00:00,IWArticle
Nestlé to ferment global RTD coffee growth?,"Nestlé is planning an assault on the immature global RTD coffee market with a new, globally patented fermented non-alcoholic product.","<p>Nestlé is planning an assault on the immature global RTD coffee market with a new, globally patented fermented non-alcoholic product.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Previously, Nestlé has failed to make much of an impact in RTD coffee. The company is only the seventh biggest company in RTD coffee with less than 6% of the 3.3 billion-litre market. This compares to being the biggest coffee manufacturer in the world with 21% of the US$36.1 billion market, based almost entirely on instant coffee.</p>
<p>The product, which pours and foams like a beer and with a strong coffee flavour and has a concentrated caffeine kick. It is likely to be launched as a premium coffee variant, which would complement its standard Nescafé product, globally. It is most likely to be launched in countries most susceptible to premium products.</p>
<h3>Small and not that beautiful </h3>
<p>Nestlé's global RTD coffee strength is based on its Nescafé variant. Most of the company's sales are in the dominant RTD coffee market, Japan, which accounted for 83% of global sector sales. The company was only the seventh biggest company in RTD coffee there, seeing its share decline to less than 5% in 2004. It is also the biggest player in the minor 22 million-litre Western European market. </p>
<h3>Limited markets </h3>
<p>The most obvious place for its initial launch would be Japan, whose population appreciate innovative products and the drink could well stimulate the company's flagging sales there. The other country that would welcome such a premium product is the US. The country is already the fourth biggest consumer of RTD coffee with sales of 120 million litres in 2004 and whose consumers have a penchant for premium products. Additionally, Nestlé could also consider the larger markets in Asia Pacific, most notably South Korea and Taiwan, the second and third biggest markets for RTD coffee globally. </p>",436,1,156,2005-11-08 11:12:53,42596,39,2005-11-07 00:00:00,IWArticle

A taste for Western-style products amongst its consumers has made Eastern Europe a highly desirable location for foodservice operators looking for fresh opportunities. Western-style coffee is proving popular in Eastern Europe's blossoming consumer culture, as evidenced by the increasing coffee consumption in the region and by the growth of specialist coffee shop chains.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>COFFEE POURS INTO EASTERN EUROPE</h3>
<p>A consumer base with a passion for Western-style products and increased spending power makes Eastern Europe a highly desirable location for foodservice operators looking for fresh avenues to explore. Since coming out from under the Iron Curtain, the former communist countries of Eastern Europe have developed a penchant for Western goods. Furthermore, after some countries joined the EU in 2004 (namely: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) the improved standard of living expected by these countries is likely to increase consumers' ability to satisfy their desire for Western products. </p>
<p>With a coffee craze hitting the region, the success of specialist coffee shops is particularly strong in Eastern Europe, with Romania, Russia, the Czech Republic and Poland showing the highest growth.</p>
<p>In addition to benefiting from the local population's newfound predilection for coffee, companies have gained custom from the heavy tourist traffic the region is witnessing. Tourism is being boosted in particular by visits from Western Europeans eager to explore the countries that were inaccessible under communism. </p>
<p>Eastern Europe's rise to prominence as a tourist destination, combined with the increased spending power of its inhabitants, provides coffee chains with enormous potential to expand in this, as yet, vastly underdeveloped region.</p>
<h3>Poland among the hottest development countries </h3>
<p>Poland, located right at the heart of Europe, often serves as a launch pad for Western companies seeking to move their wares eastward. As one of the most populous countries in Eastern Europe, with a pre-existing coffee tradition to build on, the country offers enormous potential to international players wishing to expand in the region. </p>
<p>The growing affluence of the population means that Poles have more money to spend on non-essential items and activities, such as eating out. Poles are also working longer hours and leading more hectic lifestyles, which means increased demand for simple meals and snacks that are available 24 hours a day. </p>
<p>International chains such as Café Tchibo, Coffeeheaven, Café Nescafé and Segafredo have already opened coffee shop operations in Poland, with sales witnessing phenomenal growth as a result. Specialist coffee shops sales in Poland are forecast to grow by more than 85% between 2004 and 2009, reaching EUR67 million in the latter year.</p>
<p>While local operators hold the largest shares of domestic sales, Coffeeheaven International Polska SA holds the lead among the international chains and made significant inroads in recent years. Coffeeheaven operates as a subsidiary of UK-based Coffeeheaven International plc. The company had 24 coffee shops in Poland at the end of 2004 and plans to increase this number to 50  by 2006. </p>
<p>Coffeeheaven boasts that its cafés [are “as familiar and relaxed as cafés in London, Paris or Rome”. The Western influence on Coffeeheaven is apparent in its outlets' stylish contemporary décor and offerings such as wraps, paninis and salads, as well as brownies, cookies and pastries. </p>
<p>Coffeeheaven has achieved a prominent position in Polish coffee shop sales by strategically locating its cafés in downtown areas of Warsaw and other large cities and targeting areas of high retail penetration, such as shopping centres, offices and commercial complexes, including hotels and airports.</p>
<p>Coffeeheaven plans to become a leader in Eastern Europe as a whole. It already has locations in the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Latvia and has further ambitions to open coffee shops in Romania and Bulgaria. These countries hold great promise as they are due to join the EU in 2007 and are expected to enjoy an increased standard of living after this event.</p>
<h3>Retailers make their presence known </h3>
<p>Tchibo paved its way to success in Eastern European coffee shop sales by first creating consumer awareness of its brand through distribution via the retail channel. The company's achievements through the retail channel in Eastern Europe are formidable. Since 1992, it has established itself as one of the leading coffee suppliers [in Russia, Hungary and Romania. It also has a presence in other countries within the region</p>
<p>After making a name for itself as Poland's largest coffee producer, Tchibo made its first foray into coffee shops in the country in 2003. Thus far, Poland is the only country in the region where Tchibo operates coffee shops. However, it has laid the groundwork for the establishment of coffee shops in other countries in the region by creating not only a distribution network but also a customer base that is familiar with its coffee. </p>
<p>Tchibo is not alone in setting out to establish consumer awareness in Eastern Europe through retail sales prior to launching coffee shop operations in the region. Nestlé and Segafredo Zanetti used similar tactics before launching Café Nescafé and Segafredo Espresso Café.</p>
<p>Nestlé launched its instant coffee brand Nescafé in Poland in 1993. Nescafé is now one of the most popular instant coffees in Poland through a high level of brand exposure, achieved not just through distribution in retail stores but also through vending machines in locations as diverse as cinemas, bars and universities. With the presence of the Nescafé brand firmly established, Nestlé launched Café Nescafé and opened 20 coffee shops by 2004. Café Nescafé is also present in the Czech Republic and in the less developed countries of Romania and Hungary.</p>
<p>Like Tchibo and Nestlé, Segafredo Zanetti has expanded in Eastern Europe, with its Segafredo Espresso Cafés. This company is Italy's largest coffee roaster and one of the world's top suppliers of fresh ground coffee. The family-run company fuels the growth of its Italian-style coffee shops through franchises and acquisitions. In 2005, the company owns 33 shops in the region. The majority of these are located in the Czech Republic and Hungary, whose prominence as tourist destinations and rising levels of disposable income among their local populations suggest strong potential for coffee shop sales. </p>
<h3>Local chains expanding </h3>
<p>While international chains are moving into the region and expanding their operations, local operators, such as Russian-based Montana Coffee and Idealnaya Chashka (“Ideal Cup”), have established successful operations on their home turf. </p>
<p>Latvian-based Double Coffee, established in 2002 and with 16 cafés in its hometown of Riga by 2005, has made a significant showing in the region with its unique take on the specialist coffee shop. This is something of an enhanced version of those found in the US and Western Europe. Double Coffee has followed the trend set by Starbucks and imitators, enticing customers to linger by offering an ultra-comfortable atmosphere with newspapers, wireless internet access and community bulletin boards.</p>
<p>However, Double Coffee differs from many Western specialist coffee shops, which typically cater primarily to young professionals and students, by not limiting itself to these consumer groups. The chain also caters to families by including special items for children on its menu. The company further differs from its Western counterparts by offering a much more extensive menu, including items such as omelettes and porridge for breakfast, as well as highly diverse and unusual meals and a wide range of snacks. The company also serves cocktails and coffee drinks containing alcohol. As Double Coffee explains on its website, while it is primarily concerned with coffee, it does not confine itself to just coffee. </p>
<p>Double Coffee quickly expanded in Eastern Europe, following its initial success in Latvia. It is now present in Estonia and Lithuania and is in the process of establishing itself in the Ukraine and Belarus. Double Coffee's growth throughout the region demonstrates that innovation and hybrid versions of coffee shops can help achieve success. Other coffee shop chains, regardless of whether they are local or imported, could likewise achieve growth with outlets that incorporate trendy Western elements while, at the same time, catering to regional tastes and preferences. </p>
<h3>Russia's coffee renaissance attracts global players </h3>
<p>In Russia, local coffee chain operators control the majority of speciality coffee shops, which arose to meet the demands of a growing urban consumer society. Russia's coffee culture took off in 1996 when a US businessman opened Coffee Bean. This pioneering chain was soon followed by a slew of independent coffee houses and roasting operations established by local entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Café society is not entirely new to Russians. Coffee houses were a fashionable feature of Moscow and St Petersburg before communism brought about their demise and made even poor-quality instant coffee difficult to find. The fact that Russians can re-experience their old love for coffee and do so in a Western style is emblematic of the incredible shift the country has witnessed since communism fell and consumer culture took off. </p>
<p>With the Russian coffee renaissance well on its way, the country is now coming up on the radar of international companies seeking to expand their operations, including Italy's Segafredo Zanetti. </p>
<p>There are a number of factors that make Russia an attractive place for global players to set up shop. First of all, there is an enormous population of 147 million people who love both coffee and Western products. In addition, busy urbanites, particularly students and prosperous young professionals, are increasingly eating out. For these consumer groups, coffee is no longer a utilitarian drink but one to be savoured in fashionable surroundings. There is also a gap to be filled between the country's old-fashioned cafés that serve poor-quality fare and more expensive and formal restaurants. Companies that can fill this gap and do so with a Western flair will be most likely to prosper in the region. </p>
<p>Global operators McDonald's and Starbucks have just the sort of Western cachet that young trendy Russian urbanites long for. Both chose Russia as their gateway into Eastern Europe, launching coffee shop operations in the country in 2005. McDonald's, which has had a presence in the country since 1999, plans to open 45 coffee houses in Russia by 2008, opening in the region of 10 by the end of 2005. Operating under the name Mak Kafe, the coffee shops will operate near existing McDonald's restaurants, which numbered 127 in 2004. </p>
<p>Starbucks made its Eastern European debut in May 2005 in Marriott's Moscow Renaissance Hotel, where it operates through a partnership with Marriott International. The coffee giant's entry was delayed by a legal dispute with a local company over ownership of the Starbucks trademark in Russia, which Starbucks registered in 1997. When Starbucks had still not used the trademark three years later, the Russian company, called OOO Starbucks, claimed it as its own. </p>
<p>With the dispute now settled, Starbucks plans to expand in Russia by forming joint partnerships with locally operating companies. It intends to make up for its delayed entry by acquiring sites from chains already operating in Russia. </p>
<p>Western-style coffee shops, such as Starbucks and Mak Kafe, which do not allow smoking or serve alcohol, stand out as novelties. Russian brands typically offer alcoholic drinks as part of their fare. The novelty appeal of Starbucks and McDonald's is further enhanced by their strong marketing, which is likely to make them popular with young people.</p>
<h3>Challenges </h3>
<p>While the coffee business is booming in Eastern Europe, companies are facing some significant challenges in the region. Although accession to the EU by the above listed countries (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) means that Eastern European consumers are  enjoying an improved standard of living and an increased ability to afford non-essential items, for companies, it has meant higher raw material, energy, rent and labour costs. These rising costs have been reflected in higher prices for consumer goods, pushing non-essential expenditure on items such as coffee shop purchases beyond the reach of many mainstream consumers, whose incomes may not have caught up with rising costs. </p>
<p>Companies that offer a less expensive version of the trendy coffee shop will succeed in capturing those consumers who want to be a part of the coffee culture, but can only do so if prices are lower. McDonald's followed this strategy in other countries with its McCafé concept and is just starting to follow a similar strategy in Eastern Europe with Mak Kafe.</p>
<p>To accommodate the lower household incomes of consumers in Eastern Europe, international chains will have to charge significantly less than they do in Western Europe. This practice has been adopted by some international operators who have already set up shops in the region. For example, in Segafredo Espresso: Cafés in Germany and the UK, the average spend per transaction is around EUR6.00, while, in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, it is significantly lower, ranging between €3.00-4.00. In Romania, it is less than €3.00. </p>
<p>Another challenge faced by coffee shops is that, for many Eastern Europeans, the concept of eating out is new. While it may be easy to entice the region's younger generation with anything Western, it may be more difficult to convince the older generation to spend its money in coffee shops. </p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the region holds great promise and the growth of specialist coffee shops is expected to continue. A CAGR of around 27% in constant value terms is expected between 2004 and 2009, with sales reaching over EUR960 million by 2009.</p>",121901,2,166,2009-10-16 21:26:06,42921,39,2005-11-21 00:00:00,IWArticle
Country Focus: Are RTD coffee sales going to perk up in the US?,US RTD coffee sales are showing signs of growth as drinks majors take an interest in the subsector.,"<p>US RTD coffee sales are showing signs of growth as drinks majors take an interest in the subsector.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Both Cadbury Schweppes and Coca-Cola have entered into distribution agreements for Cinnabon RTD Coffee. Coca-Cola, along with PepsiCo, has also launched a coffee-flavoured cola carbonate. The involvement of such major drinks players in the 118 million-litre US RTD coffee sector suggests a sales surge is near. So far the PepsiCo/Starbuck's joint venture has been almost solely responsible for driving growth, with reached 16% last year. Challenges to its 98% strangle-hold on the sector can only push up sales beyond this level.</p>
<h3>Chance to perk up sales</h3>
<p>Both Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, which will be distributing Cinnabon's RTD Coffee in different parts of the country, could be interested in expanding sales nationally or using the venture as a test-run for potential innovation of their own brands in the future. Coca-Cola, in particular, is increasingly on the lookout for chances to broaden its non-carbonates portfolio. In addition, Coca-Cola already has a range of RTD coffee brands in Japan that it may consider introducing to the US market.</p>
<h3>Boom times ahead?</h3>
<p>The potential that either firm could squeeze out of the Cinnabon deal still relies on the size of demand for cold coffee in the US. Coca-Cola's failed Planet Java brand does not bode well. Much will depend on the success of these limited role outs and the coffee-flavoured cola carbonate variants.</p>",436,1,156,2005-12-14 14:12:33,43288,39,2005-12-09 00:00:00,IWArticle

<p>Key innovations include ""pod"" type appliances or machines, sometimes referred to as ""closed system"" machines, which minimise mess by acting in much the same way as a teabag for coffee; and also fully automatic models, which both grind coffee beans and prepare coffee.

Ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee given a break by café culture,"A major consequence of coffee shops springing up across the globe has been an increase in total coffee consumption, with the number of coffee houses mushrooming since the mid-1990s.

<p>A major consequence of coffee shops springing up across the globe has been an increase in total coffee consumption, with the number of coffee houses mushrooming since the mid-1990s. New scenarios for drinking coffee have emerged as a result of this boom, and beverage manufacturers, such as those who produce RTD coffee, are cashing in on the consumer's acquired taste for coffee.</p>
<h3>RTD coffee reaches out to young consumers</h3>
<p>Although consumers tend to drink more coffee as they age, the industry has been rejuvenated by the emergence of coffee chains that are not only frequented by baby boomers continuing their coffee consumption habits as they age, but by an increasingly young base of consumers in their 20s and 30s. Interestingly, these trends are trickling down to even younger consumers in their late teens and early 20s. Consumers in their early teens are also more likely to drink a cup of coffee on an ad hoc basis, although the percentage is still very low.</p>
<p>RTD coffee is conveniently building a bridge between fully fledged coffee drinkers and teenagers who still have an affinity for soft drinks, but are slowly becoming familiar with the culture of coffee drinking that surrounds them.</p>
<h3>Sweet coffee indulgence </h3>
<p>Product launches in the US in the 1990s are a reflection of the crossover taking place between soft drinks and coffee, and the way in which manufacturers are keen to appeal to young coffee consumers, particularly those aged between 18 and 24 years. Teenage consumers appear to be undergoing a natural progression towards drinking the 'real thing', which may begin with iced coffee, or a chocolate and cream laden speciality, such as mocha, before they move onto stronger offerings, such as cappuccino and espresso. </p>
<p>Bearing in mind that younger consumers tend to seek out sweeter coffees, this may explain the success of Frappuccino, owned by the North American Coffee Partnership (a joint venture between Starbucks and PepsiCo), which enjoyed a 91% volume share of RTD coffee sales in the US in 2004, according to Euromonitor International's research. The Starbucks range of rich and indulgent bottled Frappuccinos, described as 'bottled euphoria' and 'luscious' on the company's website, comes in a variety of flavours, including Mocha, Vanilla and Caramel. </p>
<p>The introduction of such coffees may also be a ploy by companies to encourage consumers to commit to their products at an early age, to ensure that when they are older and make the switch to hot coffee, they stick to the same brand.</p>
<h3>Japanese consumers wake up to 'Starbucks Discoveries'</h3>
<p></p><img unselectable=""on"" style=""margin-right: 10px; float: left;"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\c30b3acd-270e-4855-9f6e-a15c9431b441.jpg""><p>Sweet and flavoured coffees are also all the rage in Asia-Pacific, where younger consumers generally have a preference for milder coffees, and Starbucks launched Starbucks Discoveries in Japan in autumn 2005, the company's first RTD brand to be introduced outside of North America.</p>
<p>In Japan – a nation of coffee drinkers and lovers of all things Western – coffee consumption has slightly moved away from the coffee shop, and consumers are more likely to purchase products in a retail environment. According to Euromonitor International, foodservice volume sales of coffee reached just 77,493 tonnes in 2004, compared with 105,550 tonnes in retail volume terms.</p>
<p>Fears of saturation in the chained coffee shop industry in Japan, and increased competition, have undermined Starbucks' profits, and its recent decision to introduce a ready-to-drink format in convenience stores may be a cunning move on its part.</p>
<p>But, Starbucks will have to do something quite unique in order to penetrate Japan's RTD coffee market, which is already well established. The use of a chilled cup not only marks the company's first entry into RTD coffee with this style of packaging, but also suggests an attempt by Starbucks to target the top end of the market where there is more potential for growth. The packaging also reinforces the coffee shop concept, creating an opportunity for Starbucks to lean on the good reputation that it has already built in the country. </p>
<p>Additionally, Starbucks Discoveries has a 14-day shelf life, one of the shortest on the market. Playing on freshness is a key marketing strategy that may pay off in future because, in the past, Japanese consumers responded well to quality, which usually takes precedence over price.</p>
<p>In view of Starbucks Discoveries' quality, fresh image, it is unlikely that the brand will be seen in vending machines, unlike the country's number one brand, Georgia, which is owned by The Coca-Cola Co. Starbucks also differentiates itself from other brands in the way that it appears to be marketing itself towards young professionals, because RTD coffee in Japan, unlike many markets in the world, is frequently geared towards working men, as well as being packaged in a metal can. This has certainly been the case for Georgia, which enjoyed a 35% share of retail value sales of RTD coffee in 2004. However, in recent years, Japan's RTD coffee producers have been attempting to target young female consumers with quirky packaging formats, such as the aluminium bottle can. In fact, these products may present the biggest challenge to Starbucks Discoveries, if they target the same consumers.</p>
<h3>Mixed opportunities for RTD coffee in Europe</h3>
<p>On the other side of the ocean in Europe, the market for RTD coffee is a mixed bag in terms of performance, and not many countries have taken to the soft drink as keenly as Japanese consumers. Although regular coffee has been embraced with open arms in Japan, the deeply engrained longstanding tradition of coffee drinking in Europe, particularly in Mediterranean countries, has had an impact on consumers' perceptions of when, where and how to drink coffee. In such cases, sales have failed to lift off the ground, while certain parts of Eastern Europe in particular, such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia – which have embraced the Western notion of consumerism since the fall of the iron curtain – have witnessed considerable growth in RTD coffee value and volume sales.</p>

<p>The market for RTD coffee in the UK is dominated by Kenco Ice Cappio, which is marketed as an indulgent, creamy chilled coffee drink, packaged in a can and designed to appeal to impulse buyers. There are also a number of niche players, but the size of the market is nevertheless very small, and there is considerable room for growth.</p>
<p>There are signs however that beverage companies in the UK are aware of the possibilities and potential for coffee being consumed in different scenarios and that they are eager to widen their consumer bases by increasing beverage categories. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, preconceived notions appear to be having the opposite effect on RTD coffee in Germany, where consumers love a good cup of quality ground coffee. A cup of fresh coffee with cake in the afternoon is to Germans what afternoon tea is to the British. However, the traditional image and lack of convenience associated with 'Kaffee Klatsch', as it is known in Germany, has proven a setback, and young consumers with increasingly demanding schedules are the driving force behind change. The coffee shop culture has become part of everyday life for many consumers, who are less likely to be caught up in the traditions of drinking fresh coffee at home, and are more open to new formats and flavours such as speciality instant or ready-to-drink coffee.</p>
<h3>RTD coffee receives a boost from the energy concept</h3>
<p>The leading brand of RTD coffee in Germany, Nescafé Xpress, is produced as a result of a joint venture between The Coca-Cola Co and Nestlé SA, and boasts high caffeine levels on the brand's website, where it is described as 'the pleasure that recharges'. The beverage contains a double shot of caffeine and is boldly marketed towards men, particularly male drivers. This explains the introduction of convenient PET bottles in 2004.</p>
<p>RTD coffee manufacturers appear keen to tap into the 'energy can' concept by targeting 18-24-year-olds, and the use of slim metal cans for RTD coffee is fast emerging into a frequently used marketing strategy. This was clearly relevant in the US in 2002 when Starbucks introduced 'DoubleShot' in a can, through a joint venture with PepsiCo Inc called the North American Coffee Partnership and currently the second leading RTD coffee brand in the US – although its share, at nearly 7%, compares weakly with the partnership's other brand, Frappuccino. </p>
<p>Moreover, as the market for energy drinks reaches its peak, the trend is working both ways, with energy drink producers attempting to cash into sales of RTD coffee. This was evident in 2005 when Krating Daeng canned RTD coffee was launched by Red Bull Beverage Co Ltd in Thailand, reflecting a growing interest in ready-to-drink coffee.</p>
<h3>Dairy producers make good coffee sense </h3>
<p>Certain European dairy producers, also keen to gain a stake in RTD coffee, have introduced milk-flavoured coffee drinks, such as Munsterland, which launched Eis-café and Eis-choc in slimline 25cl cans, designed to appeal to young and trendy consumers, in February 2004. Madeta from the Czech Republic also produces iced coffees, which are promoted for their ability to boost energy levels.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Emmi Swiss dairy company launched its range of Emmi Caffe Latte beverages in the UK in 2005, including Espresso, Cappuccino and Macchiato flavours. The beverage comes in an injection-moulded K2 cup, reflecting an image that is unlike that of RTD coffee in a can, and one which complements the product's milky, smoother flavour. Caffe Latte contains the equivalent of a double espresso, while both Cappuccino and Macchiato contain 70mg of caffeine, the amount found in one cup of coffee.</p>
<h3>Soft drinks rivals compete head to head with new brands </h3><img unselectable=""on"" style=""margin-right: 10px; float: left;"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\c6afa4f5-e103-4324-94da-c1868a4e2382.jpg""><p>Manufacturers of carbonates also appear to be attempting to profit from the coffee trend. For example, PepsiCo launched Pepsi Max Cino in January 2006 in the UK, a sugar-free beverage containing approximately half the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee. And, quick on the heels of PepsiCo, France saw the launch of Coca-Cola Blak in the same month, a carbonated coffee-infused, low-calorie drink, which is said to froth when poured, and contains a third less caffeine than found in a standard cup of coffee. Pepsi Max Cino is packaged in PET bottles and metal cans, while Coca-Cola Blak is available in 250ml aluminium bottles, symbolizing the fact that both drinks, which are not really classified as RTD coffee, represent a new category within carbonates.</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola Co's decision to launch Coca-Coca Blak in France, where consumers are renowned for their love affair with coffee, can be explained by the fact that Paris is perceived as an ideal testing ground for stylish products, and this is reflected in the product's trendy packaging.</p>
<h3>Room for future growth in the UK?</h3>
<p>Some industry critics may perceive these recent introductions as risky, especially in view of past failures, such as Nescafé Ice, which was dropped from the UK by Nestlé in 2002 because of low sales. However, the much larger RTD coffee market in the US has managed to overcome many hurdles, while seeing a range of products dropped from shelves. Furthermore, there are rumours circulating in the media that Nestlé is making strides to enter RTD coffee once again, with the launch of a fermented non-alcoholic beverage that has a strong coffee flavour, which foams like beer when poured.</p>
<p>Taste used to be an issue in the US as manufacturers strove to find the right balance, attempting to move their products beyond cold coffee or milky versions of watered-down coffee. The most successful beverage companies appear to have found the right formula by coaxing the consumer with value-added products that offer additional benefits, such as varied flavours, indulgence or energy.</p>
<p>The future success of RTD coffee in the UK may also hinge on iced coffees being made more readily available within the foodservice environment, so that consumers have an opportunity to develop an appreciation for these beverages before they commit to purchases through retail outlets.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the initiative, drive and marketing muscle of big players testing the water with new product launches, while attempting to tap into the coffee drinking habits of consumers, may provide a much needed promotion boost and bring RTD coffee closer into the mainstream.</p>

Coffee goes gourmet,"While consumers have long regarded hot drinks as commodity items, increased health-awareness and the need for convenience have resulted in innovation and the introduction of new premium products which are heating up the industry. Euromonitor International's Non-alcoholic Drinks Analyst Catherine Mars explores key coffee trends for 2006.","<p>While consumers have long regarded hot drinks as commodity items, increased health-awareness and the need for convenience have resulted in innovation and the introduction of new premium products which are heating up the industry. Euromonitor International's Non-alcoholic Drinks Analyst Catherine Mars explores key coffee trends for 2006.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Coffee continues to dominate </h3>
<p>Despite health concerns coffee continues to dominate the global hot drinks market accounting for 58% of retail sales in value terms in 2005. On-trade sales accounted for over a fifth of total volume sales of coffee in 2005 and Euromonitor International expects to see coffee sales growing more quickly in foodservice outlets than in retail outlets in line with the on-the-go lifestyle and café culture of major developed markets such as the USA. </p>
<h3>Café culture fuels gourmet trend</h3>
<p>Chained coffee shops such as Starbucks have helped fuel interest in different coffee varieties, while inspiring consumers to purchase value-added products on a retail level. Gourmet coffee is considered an affordable luxury in developed markets and is gaining popularity among consumer groups with relatively high disposable income who are willing to pay a premium for self-indulgent products. And in traditional tea-drinking countries (such as China, Russia and India) where coffee is still considered a novelty, a cup of Starbucks coffee is sometimes deemed an aspirational lifestyle purchase. </p>
<p>As a result of the café culture, consumers in developed markets are becoming more discerning coffee drinkers. Their tastes of becoming more sophisticated and they are more aware of the different types of coffee available as well as the social and environmental impacts of coffee production. In mature coffee markets which are approaching saturation, manufacturers have succeeded in spurring retail value sales by introducing coffee pod machines which enable consumers to re-create the “café experience” at home. Sales of coffee pods have taken off in some traditional coffee-drinking countries such as France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, for example, coffee pods accounted for almost 30% of retail value sales of fresh ground coffee in 2005. </p>
<h3>Trading up to cause-related coffees </h3>
<p>The trend towards trading up is further evidenced by the rising popularity of cause-related coffees which are premium products by nature. Following the collapse of global green coffee prices in 2001 the Fair Trade movement has ensured that small-scale growers and cooperatives receive a fair price for their produce. The high profile generated by Fair Trade has stimlated consumer demand for Fair Trade products and a growing number of coffee companies are now paying premium prices for Fair Trade Certified beans. </p>
<p>Although Fair Trade coffee only accounts for a small percentage of total coffee sales worldwide, consumers, particularly in developed markets, are increasingly aware of the welfare of coffee growers, and many markets have seen a growth in consumption of Fair Trade coffee over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>In line with the health and wellness trend, demand for organic coffee is also growing. According to Euromonitor International, organic coffee accounted for appromximately 1% of retail sales of coffee in value terms in 2005. However, value growth of organic coffee (62%) outstripped the coffee category (32%) between 2002 and 2005. </p>
<p>It is estimated that approximately 80% of  Fair Trade coffees are also certified organic as Fair Trade criteria require sustainable farming techniques and offer an extra premium for organic production. Additionally most Fair Trade coffees are shade-grown meaning that no forests were cleared to make room for coffee plantations (another cause that has been taken up by environmentally aware consumers). </p>
<h3>Instant coffee goes premium too</h3>
<p>Instant coffee offers a convenient alternative to fresh coffee and has experienced stronger growth than fresh coffee in volume terms over the last few years, a trend that Euromonitor International expects to continue as consumers in non-traditional coffee-drinking countries start to incorporate instant coffee into their daily routines. </p>
<p>Challenged by ageing populations and market maturity in developed Western coffee markets, manufacturers have focused on increasing consumption among younger consumers who are not typical coffee consumers and are easily distracted by high-profile marketing campaigns for soft drinks. Milder, creamy coffee and flavoured instant coffee have been introduced to meet the increasingly diverse demand patterns shown by young consumers. Some products such as instant mocha, cappuccino and latte attempt to emulate the flavour and taste consumers can find in popular coffee chains. </p>
<p>The gourmet trend is set to continue to be the most important factor shaping consumption patterns of coffee thus Euromonnitor International expects to see more products designed to translate the café experience to the at-home environment. Additionally premium products including low-caffeine, high-in-antioxidants and low-sugar/calorie products that are also fortified/enhanced with calcium and vitamins are expected to benefit from demand for health-orientated hot drinks. Euromonitor International believes that overall, convenience, health awareness, increased product segmentation, wider distribution, and highly developed consumer tastes will mould the industry, whilst acting as the cornerstones of growth in future.</p>",26338,2,241,2009-10-16 21:29:42,46995,39,2006-04-24 00:00:00,IWArticle
Industry mulls over price upturn on green coffee,"Vietnam, a country that sat on the sidelines of the coffee industry in 1990 when it produced a mere 1% of world supply, now provides an impressive 15%.

However, the tide is beginning to turn.","<p>Vietnam, a country that sat on the sidelines of the coffee industry in 1990 when it produced a mere 1% of world supply, now provides an impressive 15%. This influx of produce created a mountain of cheap robusta beans just after the millennium, which sent tremors through the coffee farming industry, and undermined value growth in Western markets. However, the tide is beginning to turn.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>A game of supply and demand</h3>
<p>Coffee plantations across the globe which were unable to cover their production costs ultimately bore the brunt of the oversupply situation, and the resultant lower prices. It is estimated that half a million Central American workers lost their jobs during what came to be known as the “coffee crisis”. </p>
<p>By 2001 prices had hit their lowest point for 30 years, and there were drastic proposals for supply management. In Guatemala in April 2001 excess coffee stocks were burned in an experiment to see whether they could be used as fuel. Around the same time, Oxfam proposed the destruction of a million tonnes of surplus coffee.</p>
<p>Price and supply fluctuations have become an unavoidable reality in the coffee industry. Coffee is a cyclical crop, and as global supplies increase the price of coffee drops – to levels often below farming costs. Many growers are then forced out of business, which in turn reduces global supply levels, resulting in prices climbing once more.</p>
<p>The industry has not always been exposed to such volatility, however, because until 1989 the International Coffee Agreement helped safeguard coffee supplies and prices. The environment only changed when previously non-coffee producing countries began to swamp an already mature market with their crops, at a time when demand was dampened by competition from other beverages which were increasingly appealing to young consumers, such as soft drinks. </p>
<h3>Coffee giants absorb highs and lows</h3>
<p>Even though price stability at retail level is more likely when coffee production is closely aligned with consumption needs, the temperamental nature of global coffee supplies has a relatively minimal effect on consumer prices. In other words, while green coffee prices may fluctuate considerably, changes in consumer prices are more moderate. </p>
<p>The coffee industry does not consist of numerous players fiercely competing with each other to keep prices low. Instead, five giants – Proctor & Gamble, Nestlé, Sara Lee, Kraft and Tchibo – yield enormous power, purchasing nearly half of the world's supply of coffee beans every year.</p>
<p>Additionally, when green coffee prices plunge there is little incentive to lower consumer prices to the same extent, because consumers do not rush out to buy more coffee when prices fall, particularly in saturated Western markets.</p>
<p>More importantly, grower prices represent such a small percentage of the final price of coffee – which can change hands as many as 150 times before hitting supermarket shelves – that their fluctuations are only marginally represented in supermarkets and coffee shops. Furthermore, other expenses, such as taxes and wages paid to coffee roasters, are fixed.</p>
<h3>Unfair premiums on fair trade</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, coffee growers and producers are at the sharp end of price and supply instability. In some cases a shaky market can have a considerable national impact, particularly in countries such as Uganda and Ethiopia, where coffee represents a sizable proportion of export earnings.</p>
<p>Fair Trade is a flourishing consumer-led movement that aims to provide protection against such price insecurities for struggling labourers and, indeed, to ensure the provision of sufficient wages to cover the cost of living.</p>
<p>The initiative is not without controversy, however, and there is evidence that retailers have been thriving on consumer goodwill. The willingness of consumers to pay a little extra for a product promoted as protecting the livelihood of workers in developing countries has encouraged some supermarkets and coffee shop chains to cash in, taking up to 90% of the premium on Fair Trade products for themselves, leaving just 10% for the impoverished growers.</p>
<p>For example, until 2004 Costa Coffee charged an extra £0.10 per cup on its Fair Trade coffee, of which farmers received roughly £0.01. The company subsequently scrapped the premium completely.</p>
<h3>Coffee supplies dry up</h3>
<p>A further problem becomes evident when green coffee prices rise above the Fair Trade guaranteed minimum price. In this situation growers are often coaxed away by the higher prices offered by middlemen, and Fair Trade expansion is thwarted.</p>
<p>This may be increasingly relevant in today's climate, as the surplus of coffee beans available during the height of the coffee crisis begins to drop, in line with the ebbs and flows of world coffee supply.</p>
<p>Various factors contribute to this process. For example, transportation costs increased notably in 2005, when the cost of crude oil exceeded US$60.00 per barrel for more than a week. In April 2006 this reached a new record price of US$75.00 per barrel – far higher than the price of around US$25.00 per barrel seen in September 2003. Furthermore, there are fears of an approaching “super spike” in oil prices, that could push oil above $100 per barrel. </p>
<p>Over 2005-2006 Brazil, the world's leading coffee-producing nation, suffered a poor harvest due to bad weather, and a reduction in the maintenance of plantations. Furthermore, in Vietnam robusta bean prices rose in January 2006 due to widespread drought, with reports that the 2005/2006 yield had fallen by as much as a 50% year on year due to lengthy dry spells.</p>
<h3>Consumer prices on the up</h3>
<p>Higher consumer prices in the West in 2005 were the result of rising demand, and an increase in the global price of green coffee. Procter & Gamble was the first of the large players to raise prices in the US in March of that year, with an average increase of 12%. Kraft and Sara Lee quickly followed suit, announcing similar price hikes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2006 Douwe Egberts announced that it would be pushing for a 6% rise in the price of its instant and ground coffee brands in the UK. Reports also surfaced in spring 2005 suggesting that the price of a 200g jar of Nescafé instant coffee had increased by 10% to £3.58. Additionally, the price of a 500g pack of coffee in Germany reached EUR4.50 – a 6-year high.</p>
<h3>Big coffee players put on a brave face</h3>
<p>By and large the coffee industry has been positive in the face adversity. After all, the saturated market was bursting at the seams with cheap coffee in the late 1990s, particularly by 2001, and it needed tweaking in order to re-secure the balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Small consumer price increases pep up value growth without having a significant impact on purchasing behaviour. And growers are ensured a decent salary when green coffee prices rise. This creates a win-win situation benefiting all parties concerned, and a happy ending ensues.</p>
<p>But the coffee industry may still be facing a rocky road ahead, and there is even talk of a possible new crisis expected to hit the industry in 2007. But this time industry sources suggest there maybe a shortfall in global coffee supplies, rather than a surplus.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem lies in the fact that global coffee consumption appears to be rising more rapidly than supply, and the very storehouses in Brazil that have traditionally helped to compensate for this discrepancy may be depleted in 2006. In fact, Brazil's 2007/2008 harvest is forecast to drop by 10%.</p>
<p>Undesirable weather conditions can have a significant impact on coffee crops, but with new coffee drinking regions such as Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe emerging on the global scene, industry dynamics are changing rapidly. Over 2000-2005 instant coffee in Eastern Europe saw value and volume gains across the board, while Asia Pacific saw some of the most vigorous volume growth in coffee sales in the world.</p>
<p>China stands out as a tea-drinking nation, with relatively few coffee drinkers. Nevertheless, retail volume sales are forecast to increase by an annual average of 10% over 2005-2010. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's state visit to China in April 2005, with coffee on his list of possible future business ventures, is testament to the potential China holds in terms of coffee market expansion.</p>
<h3>Industry braces itself for a frosty season</h3>
<p>The industry appears to be split between those who predict that prices will remain constant, while others anticipate continuing shortages during the next two years. What remains clear, however, is that failure to keep pace with demand due to supply shortages will ramp up pressure on consumer prices.</p>
<p>In the past the coffee industry has shown that it holds great leverage, and the ability to absorb green coffee price swings. Furthermore, many consumers, especially within the foodservice arena, perceive coffee as being an affordable luxury, although price sensitivity varies from country to country. In Germany, for instance, discounters have helped to keep the lid on prices, while fresh coffee sales depend heavily on promotions. At the end of 2005 there were rumours in Australia that many offices were installing coffee machines to save money on rising coffee shop prices.</p>
<p>The real challenge may lie in the coffee bean, however. Starbucks, the world's largest coffee retail chain, has contemplated increasing its purchase quota for Africa in recent years due to arabica coffee shortages, at a time when it has ambitious global expansion plans. The company currently has its eyes on Rwanda, where only arabica coffee beans are grown, and Burundi, where 90% of the coffee crop is arabica.</p>
<p>The abundance of arabica coffee from Brazil that producers tend to take for granted is becoming a distant memory. Furthermore, the “sunspot factor”, which has led to lower global temperatures and brought frost to the southern tip of Brazil, has filled the coffee industry with a sense of nervous optimism as the winter season approaches.</p>",26338,1,241,2009-10-20 09:01:57,47692,39,2006-05-22 00:00:00,IWArticle
Tata takes on coffee,Tata Coffee breaks into the global coffee market by acquisition of the Eight O'Clock brand. ,"<p>Tata Coffee breaks into the global coffee market by acquisition of the Eight O'Clock brand. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Mirroring its' well proven strategy in tea, this acquisition marks the company's first step to transform itself from a commodity company into a global branded coffee player. Tata Tea owns 51% of Tata Coffee. In 2000, Tata Tea bought the established UK-based tea brand Tetley, which it then used to enter other regions. The company went on to make further acquisitions; strengthening its position in North America and Eastern Europe, to become the global number two supplier.</p>
<h3>Eight O'Clock, time for global expansion </h3>
<p>Eight O'Clock will extend Tata Coffee's reach beyond its domestic Indian market where it is the second largest player in volume terms behind Unilever. Acquiring the fastest-growing coffee brand in the US provides Tata Coffee a strong platform to enter this key coffee market.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International data indicates that Eight O'Clock was the third largest brand by volume in the US behind Folgers and Maxwell in 2005. Initially Tata Coffee is expected to add its own instant coffees to Eight O'Clock's fresh coffee offering, allowing expansion of Eight O'Clock's position in the US market and beyond the east coast.</p>
<p>The acquisition also gives Tata Coffee access to a US distribution network beneficial to the company's other beverage divisions. The Tetley tea brand is currently fifth in value terms, in the US market with a 4% share; better distribution can only aid this position.</p>
<h3>Forwards together </h3>
<p>Once its position in the US market is cemented, precedent indicates that the company will use the Eight O'Clock brand as a vehicle to enter other international markets using the Tetley tea international distribution system. The UK will probably be the first country to see the Eight O'Clock brand followed by Russia and other Eastern European countries where the coffee category is expected to show strong growth over the next five years. Further acquisitions to help this strategy, should not be ruled out, particularly in North America and Eastern Europe. </p>",26338,1,241,2006-07-03 13:53:38,47744,39,2006-06-30 00:00:00,IWArticle
Coffee players go beyond breakfast,Increased competition for the breakfast market is leading coffee and doughnut chains to look for additional sales throughout the day.,"<p>Increased competition for the breakfast market is leading coffee and doughnut chains to look for additional sales throughout the day.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Morning coffee retailers are finding that they cannot depend on the start of the day rush hour alone, as more operators fight for a share of the market. Quick service restaurants (QSRs), led by giants such as McDonald's, are focusing on coffee and expanding breakfast menus. For QSRs in the US, breakfast is a new industry battleground. The trend is also gaining pace in mature markets across the Atlantic, such as the UK. Meaning Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and others are all introducing new products.</p>
<h3>Snack attack </h3>
<p>This week Dunkin' Donuts launched jumbo cookies to target afternoon and evening snacking in the US. Over the past few months it has also introduced savoury afternoon snacks at a handful of concept stores. The doughnut chain is following Starbucks' lead in many respects: the coffee giant is adding more snacks and light lunches. </p>
<p>These launches will help the chains tap into a growing appetite for snacks. Euromonitor International predicts that US sales of packaged sweet and savoury snacks will grow 6% annually in the short term and reach US$34 billion by 2009. </p>
<h3>Breakfast set to rise and shine </h3>
<p>Across US foodservice, operators have a sharp interest in breakfast because it has great potential for further development; busier lifestyles and longer commutes will encourage this. Within breakfast, coffee is hot. Specialist coffee shops are outperforming most of the rest of the CFS market, with forecast sales growth of 7% this year compared with 5% for full-service restaurants and 2% for fast food. Everyone wants a share in coffee sales as a way to secure breakfast growth.</p>
<p>As QSRs invade coffee players' space, coffee retailers need to maintain distinctive brand positioning. Dunkin' Donuts is wise to innovate in sweet baked goods, central to its core branding. Dunkin' Donuts must also develop premium branding for its coffee and offer upmarket innovation, perhaps with single origin coffee or fair-trade and organic blends, like Starbucks'. </p>",1535,2,311,2009-10-16 21:32:55,49402,39,2006-08-29 00:00:00,IWArticle

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Last month prices for Robusta coffee beans, which account for approximately one-third of the world's coffee, reached a new high. Euromonitor International expects prices to continue to rise due to a shortage on the world market. </p>
<p>While Robusta beans are traditionally used in instant coffee, espresso and low-cost blends, manufacturers are now turning to Arabica (a more expensive bean) which is used in gourmet coffees and by coffee shops such as Starbucks. </p>
<h3>Contracting supply </h3>
<p>The world shortage of Robusta beans can be attributed to poor harvests in Vietnam (the world's largest Robusta grower) in past year due to drought. In late August Robusta prices reached their highest level since 1999 after water damaged inventories in Italy. </p>
<p>Prices of Arabica beans haven't kept pace with Robusta because Brazil (the world's biggest coffee producer) is harvesting its second-biggest crop ever this year. However, this will not alleviate the overall coffee shortage as trees usually rest following a bumper harvest.</p>
<h3>Buoyant demand boosts prices </h3>
<p>Euromonitor International predicts a 3% rise in global coffee consumption this year to 5 million tonnes. Major coffee drinking countries such as the US and Brazil are forecast to experience strong growth in actual terms and we anticipate growing demand from new consumers in Russia, Romania and Ukraine.</p>
<p>With demand exceeding supply, the cost to consumers is expected to rise within months as importers and roasters pass on the higher commodity price. Robusta bean-based instant coffee will feel the impact first, followed by gourmet and speciality blends and finally major fresh coffee brands. </p>
<p>In the past, manufacturers have been quick to pass on price increases as a result of surging coffee commodity prices. However, the extent to which this latest high affects retail prices remains to be seen. Over the past two years orange juice futures have risen by more than 175%, but orange juice prices at retail are only up about 10%.</p>",26338,1,241,2006-09-07 19:32:57,49540,39,2006-09-06 00:00:00,IWArticle
Competition in coffee pods,The introduction of refillable coffee pods are threatening this valueable niche.,"<p>The introduction of refillable coffee pods are threatening this valueable niche.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Coffee pod machines are the latest trend in home coffee making. These single-serve home-brewing systems are developed by coffee producers in conjunction with small kitchen appliance manufacturers. For example, speciality coffee maker Green Mountain produces single-serve pods specifically for its Keurig machine. As these are generally proprietary systems, consumers are 'locked in' to a specific coffee producer's pods once they purchase a machine guaranteeing it a loyal consumer base and enabling it to justify a price premium.</p>
<p>Coffee pods are an area of strong growth for hot drinks manufacturers according to Euromonitor International, although the concept continues to do best in the markets where it is most established, including the Netherlands, Germany and the US. Yet clouds are already forming on the horizon.</p>
<h3>Competition hots up…</h3>
<p>Pricey refills, the limited selection of different blends, and the difficulty in finding pods have deterred some consumers in the past. Melitta, which ranks seventh in fresh coffee globally, has tackled these problems head-on. Last year it revamped its pods to fit both its own system as well as those marketed by competitors. More recently, the company has introduced refillable plastic pods that fit various machines. These 'padfilters' are inexpensive and can be filled with any fresh ground coffee.</p>
<p>Sara Lee, the second largest player in fresh coffee globally, pioneered the single-serve coffee system with its Senseo machine developed in partnership with Philips. Earlier this month, the company's European patent for Senseo pods was revoked, opening the gates for competitors.</p>
<h3>...and puts the freeze on prices</h3>
<p>Increased competition will drive pod prices down forcing manufacturers to look for new ways to drive up value and build loyalty. The key here will be quality. Only the best blends will be able to command the top prices. The only other option is to become a volume player, using price as the point of competitiveness. However this is unlikely to be the best path to success given that the typical coffee pod machine owner cares about quality.</p>",26338,1,241,2006-09-19 09:11:38,50299,39,2006-09-15 00:00:00,IWArticle
Coffee growth without the café,"Having taken the on-trade coffee industry by storm, Starbucks now has its sights increasingly set on the off-trade sector.","<p>Having taken the on-trade coffee industry by storm, Starbucks now has its sights increasingly set on the off-trade sector.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Starbucks is looking to accelerate the expansion of its ubiquitous coffee empire by launching a new hot drinks vending platform in 2007. If Western consumers can become used to buying premium coffee from a branded machine, the company could then perhaps expand into the under achieving sector of the hot drinks industry; RTD.</p>
<h3>Off-trade in target… </h3>
<p>Eager to extend its reach beyond the regular store network, Starbucks will introduce hot drinks vending into its repertoire in the US next year. Rural areas, gas stations and business premises all represent potentially ripe grounds, while the platform could also compliment the company's on-trade clustering-strategy. </p>
<p>Based on technology from PepsiCo, the venture builds on the companies' previous cooperation in cold RTD coffee and can be seen as an attempt to familiarise consumers with the concept of buying premium coffee from a machine. Although Frappuccino, the cold RTD brand jointly marketed by PepsiCo and Starbucks, is already available through vending, volumes remain at a low level as the majority of consumers have not yet warmed up to the idea. </p>
<h3>…Hot opportunities in a can?</h3>
<p>Although US sales of RTD coffee sales have increased rapidly in recent years, rising from US$505 million in 2001 to US$1 billion this year, per capita consumption at 0.4 litres remains extremely low in comparison to pioneering markets such as Japan (22 litres).</p>
<p>The low figure indicates that potential for further growth exists and if successful, the hot Starbucks-PepsiCo initiative could give the sector a boost by introducing consumers to RTD coffee with the help of a familiar product; hot Starbucks coffee. </p>
<p>Vending meanwhile, represents an interesting channel as it accounted for just 0.2% of US RTD coffee sales in 2005, again in stark contrast with the corresponding 25% figure in Japan. By placing the well recognised Starbucks mermaid logo on hot vending machines, the comapny is hoping to lure US coffee consumers to an unfamiliar channel; vending. If successful, the concept could later be rolled out in regions such as Western Europe, where RTD coffee consumption per capita was just 0.1 litres last year.</p>",1535,1,339,2006-11-13 14:57:58,52750,39,2006-11-02 00:00:00,IWArticle
Quality concerns push coffee prices further,The price of Robusta coffee looks set to remain at a high level as quality issues threaten to limit Vietnamese supply further,"<p>The price of Robusta coffee looks set to remain at a high level as quality issues threaten to limit Vietnamese supply further</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The price of Robusta coffee has climbed 58% over the past year, as drought has limited crop yields in Vietnam, the main producer of this low-grade variety. A further price increase may be expected on the back of news of a worrisome increase in volume of below standard Vietnamese produce, is now threatening to limit supply further. The impact on retail sales will, however, be more muted as manufacturers will be reluctant to damage volume sales by passing the full price increase onto the consumers.</p>
<h3>Weak quality </h3>
<p>The Vietnamese government is, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg, planning to implement additional quality measures to tackle a reported 19% increase in rejected coffee produce from country between October 2005 and March 2006. According to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), 88% of coffee produce considered not suitable for trade by coffee exchange LIFFE was of Vietnamese origin in that period. </p>
<p>...to tighten Robusta supply </p>
<p>The government is yet to announce further details, but whatever measures the regulators decide to take, no overnight change in supply is envisaged, as it will take time to get production up at a higher quality level. This is of particular concern given that inventories had already fallen to historically low levels due to the aforementioned bad weather.</p>
<p>In addition, as Vietnam is by far the largest supplier of Robusta in the world, it will be difficult for other countries to gear up production significantly enough to make up for the shortfall while Vietnam addresses the quality issues.</p>
<h3>Impact on instant coffee? </h3>
<p>The retail price of products based on Robusta is likely to reflect the increase in green coffee prices. While Robusta is used in some fresh coffee blends, including some Italian espresso, most is used for the production of instant coffee; currently the major growth driver in coffee. At current production levels, Euromonitor International forecasts 24% volume growth in the five-year period to 2010 in this subsector, compared to the over 10% forecast growth in fresh coffee. Therefore, repositioning products as premium could be the answer to offset the financial burden created by the increased costs of raw materials.</p>",1535,1,339,2006-11-22 16:49:50,53265,39,2006-11-22 00:00:00,IWArticle

<p>As disposable incomes have hit an all time high, the demand for something different along with the entry of both new international and local coffee chains, has made Turkey one of the most dynamic markets for specialist coffee shops in the world. Euromonitor International data indicates record value growth of around 55% to reach just under US$30 million in 2005.</p>
<h3>Consumer demand increasing</h3>
<p>Starbuck's has been operating since 2003 and it is the biggest player within CFS with around 45% of the value market. Other international and local players include Gloria Jean's, Tchibo, John's, Kahve Dunyasi, Cafe Crown and C&C.</p>
<p>December 2005 saw the German retail giant, Tchibo open its first outlet in Istanbul's Cevahir shopping centre. The company aims to expand into smaller Anatolian cities during 2007 and then on to have around 100 shops by 2010.</p>
<p>Tchibo was followed six months later, by the US coffee chain Barnie's Coffee & Tea which opened in Ankara's Ankamall. The company is aiming to open one new Turkish outlet every month, and reach 60 by 2011 according to the distributor.</p>
<h3>Understanding local preferences is key</h3>
<p>New prosperity has led interest in foreign food and beverage trends which continue to have a tremendous effect on Turkish CFS. However almost all international chains operating within the specialist coffee shops sector have adjusted their operations or menus specifically to suit Turkish lifestyle and local taste.</p>
<p>Barnie's new menu clearly reflects the Turkish consumers' desire for different aromas in coffee with less sugar and cream. Turkish coffee is only offered in its Turkish outlets, but currently, filter coffee and nut flavoured coffees are amongst the most popular.</p>
<p>Another international entrant has another solution. Drinks are traditionally served to the customer in Turkey. Therefore, unlike the rest of its global cafés, Gloria Jean's only provides table service in its Turkish outlets. The company has also modified its menu by offering Turkish coffee, as well as toast, sandwich and salads prepared to local recipes.</p>
<h3>More profit for everyone</h3>
<p>Whitbread is planning to expand Costa from 650 units currently to 2000 by 2010 worldwide and the company is planning to take the brand to Turkey. The company is expected to finalise its entry strategy by the end 2007. </p>
<p>Given that there is plenty of room for growth, other chains including Café Nero and Café Ritazza might as well be operating in this emerging market within less than a few years. </p>",23325,1,152,2007-03-22 15:59:05,68060,39,2007-03-20 00:00:00,IWArticle

<p>Red Espresso, a new rooibos product launched in South Africa, claims to be the perfect caffeine-free alternative to coffee, and comes complete with a healthy high antioxidant count. Having already achieved success in its home country, Red Espresso is about to embark on an international journey to test waters for expansion in Europe and possibly beyond.</p>
<p>The product, defined by its manufacturer as rooibos tea leaves that have been refined for use in any conventional coffee maker or tea pot, has won a national “New Product of 2006” award in its home country. The awarding body, South Africa Food Review, hailed Red Espresso for “creating a new beverage category”. Red Espresso is currently sold in South Africa through leading coffee chains in the on-trade as well as through interior store chain @home to off-trade clients.</p>

<p>Marketed through slogan “Who could have thought tea could play by coffee's rules”, Red Espresso has international ambitions. The company is running pilot tests in the United Kingdom and Germany ahead of planned launches in these two European markets during 2007. If successful, the company could then target North America and Australia, although no confirmation as to such plans has been received as of yet, with the European test phase still running. </p>
<h3>Red niche in the making? </h3>
<p>High versatility and an antioxidant-count the manufacturer says is four times higher than regular rooibos tea bode well for Red Espresso's plans to position the product as a red-hot alternative to novelty-hungry coffee drinkers in international markets. The product could piggyback on the popularity of such perennial favourites as lattes and cappuccinos to target those clients who now buy decaf or are otherwise interested in healthier products; as such, the South African speciality challenges Matcha, the Japanese high-grade green tea, as another antioxidant-rich chameleon to hit the hybrid-latte market. But whilst Red Espresso's versatility bodes well for its prospects to emerge as a new niche in health-driven premium markets, the availability of sufficient supply for a more widespread international expansion remains a questions mark. </p>",432,1,175,2007-05-04 19:14:40,70191,39,2006-12-13 00:00:00,IWArticle
Coffee shop competition heating up in India,"Italian coffee company Lavazza has bought India's second largest coffee shop chain and confirmed ambitious expansion plans for the brand, which could hinder international coffee shop chains' expansion plans in the country.","<p>Italian coffee company Lavazza has bought India's second largest coffee shop chain and confirmed ambitious expansion plans for the brand, which could hinder international coffee shop chains' expansion plans in the country.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Lavazza has bought Barista, which had about 130 outlets or some 25% of the Indian coffee shop market in 2005. The chain plans to grow to 400 outlets by 2010 and is revamping its existing stores, adding new food and drink products and wi-fi at many stores. It is also introducing a brand extension called Barista Crème. This is designed to be a lounge café targeted at slightly older, higher-income consumers than the typical 20-something coffee shop customer, according to the Economic Times of India.</p>
<h3>Domestic brands buoyant</h3>
<p>Barista is not the only domestic coffee shop brand that is flourishing, putting a question mark over prospects for international chains in the market. India's number one coffee shop chain is another rapidly expanding home-grown one - Café Coffee Day, owned by Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Co. The chain had 51% of the market (about 266 outlets) in 2005 and has plans for 500 outlets by the end of 2007.</p>
<p>India's domestic coffee shop brands tend to imitate the Starbucks “third place” concept, but with important local differences. Like Starbucks, chains such as Barista, Café Coffee Day and smaller chain Café Mocha are viewed as fashionable places in which to socialise and relax. However, this applies principally to consumers in the evening wanting to unwind after work. Unlike US coffee shops, Indian coffee shops have not yet established significant traffic with commuters on their way to work and have almost no takeaway sales. The consumer profile is generally limited to 18-30-year-old urban professionals and students. Indian coffee shops are popular for evening snacks with local flavours, for example Café Mocha offers a wide range of confectionery and food as well as hookahs to smoke.</p>
<h3>Internationals eyeing the market</h3>
<p>Starbucks and Italy's Illycaffé have plans to launch in India this year, while Gloria Jean's is understood to be planning to debut in Delhi shortly. UK chain Costa Coffee already has a limited presence in India after entering the market in 2005, with a target of 300 stores. Western brands are being attracted by flourishing niches in India for coffee consumption. Euromonitor International indicates that coffee shops in India grew 20% in 2005 to about 520 outlets and forecasts that the market will more than double to over 1,100 outlets by 2010. Potential is no longer limited to the biggest cities but is spreading to smaller ones such as Indore and Pune. This growth goes hand in hand with increasing coffee consumption at home. Retail volumes for coffee have grown steadily since 2000 and are growing faster than for tea, although they remain very small by comparison. Retail volumes for tea are more than six times those for coffee (about 33,400 tonnes compared to 220,200 tonnes for tea in 2006). Coffee in India is gaining an increasingly trendy image. Meeting over coffee is becoming a common feature of the business world, while in social contexts coffee is becoming an aspirational drink. Coffee is becoming a lifestyle symbol for many consumers, influenced by sitcoms, movies, adverts and talk shows such as “Koffee with Karan” that depict coffee-sipping role models.</p>
<h3>Winning partnerships?</h3>
<p>Picking the right local partner is crucial for international chains in India because national law does not allow 100% foreign direct investment. Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Illycaffé are choosing to form partnerships to launch their own brands, while Lavazza is opting to back a local brand. Costa Coffee operates in India via its franchisee Devyani International, while details of the partnerships planned by Starbucks and Illycaffé are not yet clear. Lavazza could have the winning combination: its expertise in coffee and financial backing paired with a local brand that is already well established.</p>
<h3>International brands need local flavours</h3>
<p>Against a backdrop of thriving domestic brands, foreign chains entering India need to emphasise their premium, international branding in order to maintain a point of distinction and they must also consider adapting their offer. Indian coffee shop consumers prefer local snacks, such as kebabs, samosas and tikki, but tend towards international flavours for coffee and ice creams. Local tastes are so important that chains such as Café Coffee Day are regionalising food menus, offering spicy items in the south and using ingredients such as paneer (cottage cheese) in northern cities. International chains should therefore focus on offering authentic indulgent drinks, whilst tailoring food for the evening day part and local tastes.</p>

Twinings enters coffee,"Premium fresh coffee is the latest addition to the Twinings family, with ongoing diversification set to strengthen its overall position in the hot beverages market. ","<p>Premium fresh coffee is the latest addition to the Twinings family, with ongoing diversification set to strengthen its overall position in the hot beverages market. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Associated British Foods' Twinings is trying to look beyond the tea market, as witnessed by its launches of RTD tea and drinking chocolate, which have now been followed by the launch of a coffee assortment. The Twinings Coffee range is designed to meet the growing demand for premium coffee, one of the key consumption trends in the UK's coffee market. Although the country's consumers are predominantly instant coffee drinkers, this category is set to decline by a CAGR of 2% between 2007 and 2011, whilst fresh coffee will record a CAGR of 4%. This represents an absolute growth of £30 million in retail sales over the forecast period, which is a sizable potential playground for Twinings' new coffee brands.</p>
<h2>Emphasis on origin </h2>
<p>Twinings has a powerful brand image in the UK and capitalising on this is likely to help build consumer trust in the coffee brand. Twinings will expand on this by focusing on the origin of its coffees and their correspondent flavours, emphasising the 100% use of Arabica beans. Initially, its fresh coffee offerings will comprise four lines: Intense, Rich, Mellow and Decaff.</p>
<h2>All round distribution</h2>
<p>Twinings coffee was first listed in the UK's major supermarkets Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury's, with others expected to follow. It is also pushing foodservice distribution, supplying various channels through its foodservice Branded Support programme. </p>
<p>Twinings Coffee range is being supported by a £3 million marketing push, including TV advertisements due in autumn this year. There will be an additional £12 million spend on the Twinings family brand for 2007. The company has forecast fresh coffee alone to generate £8.5 million worth of retail sales in its first year, meaning potentially Twinings Coffee could be positioned very close to the Fairtrade coffee giant Cafédirect (retail value of £8.9 million) in the fresh coffee category. </p>
<p>It should be noted that although Twinings Coffee range does not compete directly against private label (46% share of fresh coffee sales), especially its Fairtrade variants, the ethical consumption trend among British shoppers could mean that it is a difficult market to crack. </p>
<h2>To become a stronger hot drinks player</h2>
<p>Looking forward, Twinings is expected to continue to diversify its business outside its tea heartland and take advantage of the premiumisation trend currently being seen in the hot drinks market.</p>
<p>However, the steady spread of market share among established coffee brands in the UK indicates that hard core coffee lovers seem highly loyal to those familiar brands and this could be a potential barrier for Twinings to overcome. </p>",393,1,175,2007-08-06 13:50:51,71152,39,2007-05-16 00:00:00,IWArticle
Brazilian coffee prices on the rise,Reports that Brazilian coffee exports are set to decline will add to price pressures initially stemming from Vietnamese supply problems.,"<p>Reports that Brazilian coffee exports are set to decline will add to price pressures initially stemming from Vietnamese supply problems.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The price of Robusta coffee has increased by 23% this year due to rising demand coupled with weakened supply from Vietnam, the world's biggest grower of this coffee type. In light of reports that exports from Brazil, the world's second biggest Robusta producer, will fall are now adding to the price pressures. In addition, bad weather conditions may limit Brazilian Arabica bean crops from next season, adding upwards pressure on this type of coffee as well.</p>
<p>Brazil will consume more of its home-grown Robusta coffee this year, Bloomberg recently reported citing the Brazilian coffee exporter association; according to the Conselho dos Exportadores de Café do Brasil, domestic Robusta consumption will increase by 3.2% on the previous year in the 12-month period to September 2007. </p>
<h3>Robusta prices to remain elevated </h3>
<p>The news from Brazil will add further upwards pressure on Robusta prices, already elevated because of Vietnamese supply problems as the Vietnamese government continues to ponder additional quality measures to tackle a reported 19% increase in rejected coffee produce from country between October 2005 and March 2006. </p>
<h3>Arabica price to follow? </h3>
<p>News that Brazil will consumer more of its home-grown Robusta followed earlier reports on droughts that threaten to limit Brazilian Arabica crops next season. Due to October rains arriving too late for trees to recover from a record dry winter, some trees have not flowered properly, Bloomberg has reported citing Sao Paolo-based institute for Agricultural Economics as saying that Brazil's April-to-October harvest may shrink 28% on this year's level to a four-year low of 30 million bags. </p>
<h3>As demand show no signs of slowing… </h3>
<p>It is estimated that Brazilian crops are could remain weakened until 2008. With Vietnamese supply issue too unlikely to be solved overnight, further upwards pressure exists on coffee prices. This is particularly the case in light of growing demand, with Euromonitor International forecasting that global coffee sales will increase by 15% in the five-year period to 2010, driven by double-digit increases in demand in China, South Africa and Ukraine. Growing demand coupled with weakened supply is likely to result in further retail price increases and attempts by manufacturers to increasingly opt for premium positioning.</p>",1535,1,141,2007-05-21 10:40:01,71227,39,2007-01-21 00:00:00,IWArticle
Iced coffee a hot trend for fast food,"In an attempt to mimic the success of the Starbucks Frappuccino, other US chains are brewing up their own iced coffee products and promotions. However, the drinks face heightened competition from upmarket milkshakes and smoothies.","<p>In an attempt to mimic the success of the Starbucks Frappuccino, other US chains are brewing up their own iced coffee products and promotions. However, the drinks face heightened competition from upmarket milkshakes and smoothies.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Iced coffees are spreading far beyond coffee shops, appearing at bakery fast food chains and even burger outlets better known for serving sodas and shakes than coffees. For example, Dunkin' Donuts ran a “Free Iced Coffee Day” promotion in March, while this June Krispy Kreme is introducing Krispy Kreme Chillers iced drinks, including Lotta Latte and Mocha Dream varieties. At the same time, McDonald's is reported to be expanding its trial of speciality coffee drinks, which include iced lattes and mochas. Burger King has already launched an iced coffee, called Mocha BK Joe Iced Coffee, introduced in April. Iced coffees have the advantage of “grown-up” appeal, tempting adults and kids alike as a sophisticated chilled drink option.</p>
<h3>Competition for share of throat</h3>
<p>However, iced coffees are not the only hot trend in chilled drinks. Fast feeders are introducing more sophisticated milkshakes, and seeing results. Sales of milkshakes at Hardee's and Carl's Jr have tripled since the chains launched more upmarket hand-scooped shakes about two years ago, according to a report by USA Today. Chains are developing indulgent varieties linked with well-known treat brands, such as Burger King's Oreo BK Sundae Shake, launching this June, and Jack in the Box's shake with the flavour of Andes Crème de Menthe candies, introduced in March.</p>
<h3>Smooth moves</h3>
<p>At the same time, opportunities for smoothies are growing as consumers latch onto their appeal as a sweet indulgence that is also healthy. Chains already offering smoothies are expanding their range. For example, Dunkin' Donuts added a Tropical Fruit variety in April and Cold Stone Creamery introduced a Dew Iced smoothie in May. Furthermore, McDonald's is testing fruit smoothies, according to a report in the Chicago Sun Times that interviewed the chain's top chef Dan Coudreaut. In the UK, McDonald's is testing premium Innocent smoothies in 70 stores this summer. </p>
<h3>Logistical challenges</h3>
<p>Chains must learn from Starbucks' experience last summer, when queues for Frappuccinos clogged stores. Efficiency will be crucial to chains moving into iced coffee and fast feeders might want to consider having some drinks ready-made or bottled for customers in a hurry. </p>
<p>Starbucks' premium brand credentials and distinctive café experience put it in good stead to weather the challenge posed by fast food iced coffees. The chain could lose a portion of its Frappuccino customers to other brands if they successfully market their products as more affordable indulgences. Starbucks must continue to promote quality and innovation in its range, and it is doing so, with the launch of its new Orange Crème Frappuccino. </p>",1535,1,311,2007-06-22 12:03:49,71924,39,2007-06-01 00:00:00,IWArticle
Costa Coffee expanding in Eastern Europe,"Whitbread's coffee shop chain is forging a deal to step up its growth plans, with a focus on the Balkans.","<p>Whitbread's coffee shop chain is forging a deal to step up its growth plans, with a focus on the Balkans.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The UK company is close to signing a franchise agreement with Serbian retail group Delta to take Costa Coffee into Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia and Slovenia, according to Reuters. The first nine outlets will open in Serbia, with plans for regional expansion as of 2008. Whitbread has already announced that Costa Coffee is entering Bulgaria, Poland and Romania and intends to expand to 2,000 stores worldwide by 2010. The chain may be able to tap into a budding market for coffee shops in Eastern Europe to drive it towards its growth target.</p>
<h3>Market potential</h3>
<p>The combined population of the markets Costa Coffee is entering via Delta is about 26.5 million people. Furthermore, there is a peak in the Eastern European population around the age range of 20 to 25, which is good news for coffee shops looking to target young professionals. Economic conditions in the Balkans are also encouraging. An economic recovery began in the southern-most states of Eastern Europe around the turn of the century, following the end of the war in Kosovo, although living standards are still significantly lower than in EU accession countries.</p>
<h3>Obstacles ahead</h3>
<p>Costa Coffee must adapt to a market where not only chained coffee shops are a relatively new concept but also consumer foodservice as a whole is underdeveloped. Eastern Europe has strong traditions of home cooking and independent outlets. Independents account for about 180,000 out of some 182,000 cafés and bars in Eastern Europe. The region is also characterised by relatively low levels of urbanisation: in 2006 around 66% of the population lived in urban areas, compared with 77% in Western Europe. Furthermore, Costa Coffee faces competition from local brands, especially Coffee Heaven and Coffeeright. Coffee Heaven is expanding rapidly across the region and was the market leader in Poland in 2006, while Coffeeright was the market leader in Romania last year.</p>
<h3>Going places</h3>
<p>Eastern Europe had some 1,800 coffee shops in 2006 and the market is forecast to grow by 9% annually to 2011, expanding by about 1,000 outlets. To make the most of the growth trend, Costa Coffee should focus on urban and tourist markets. Tourism is especially important because business travel is developing in the region, alongside increasing leisure tourism. The chain should concentrate on sites in travel hubs, business districts and shopping malls, making sure that menus are accessible to foreigners. </p>",1535,1,311,2007-09-03 13:10:55,76255,39,2007-08-17 00:00:00,IWArticle
Premium chocolate expands to coffee shops,Coffee retailing giant Starbucks recently announced an agreement with US confectionery group Hershey that will see the creation and distribution of Starbucks-branded premium chocolate in the US. This strategy might represent a valid example for other manufacturers seeking to expand their product reach beyond the traditional grocery channel.,"<p>Coffee retailing giant Starbucks recently announced an agreement with US confectionery group Hershey that will see the creation and distribution of Starbucks-branded premium chocolate in the US. This strategy might represent a valid example for other manufacturers seeking to expand their product reach beyond the traditional grocery channel.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>New developments will carry the Starbucks brand</h3>
<p>The alliance will draw on the premium expertise of Artisan Confections Company, a wholly- owned subsidiary of The Hershey Co, which markets premium chocolate offerings like Scharffen Berger, known for its high-cacao dark chocolate products, and Joseph Schmidt, recognised for its fine, handcrafted chocolate gifts.</p>
<p>Artisan Confections Company will deal with the development of products that use Starbucks coffee flavours as their base. The company says the chocolate could also include fruit, nuts, herbs and spices and will carry the Starbucks brand name.</p>
<p>Hershey's alliance with Starbucks is consistent with its growth strategy, which has increasingly focused in recent years on trying to enhance the premium aspect of its chocolate confectionery range. Recent examples of this strategy include the launch of a premium chocolate bar line made from cocoa beans sourced from specific countries and the acquisition of the organic chocolate manufacturer Dagoba. Both these actions were carried out in late 2006. Hershey's chocolate products in Starbucks are also positioned in this premium segment. Moreover, this premium positioning is further bolstered by its focus on the foodservice arena, where consumers are generally more willing to pay a premium for indulgence.</p>
<h3>A valid addition to current distribution networks</h3>
<p>The development of premium lines for distribution through foodservice channels is a valid option not only for mainstream companies but also for small and medium-sized players wishing to specialise in the niche 'connoisseur' segment of the market. Such producers might find the introduction of their products to specialist coffee chains to be a valuable addition to their current distribution network of confectionery specialists. </p>
<p>Examples highlighted by Euromonitor International include companies such as Cémoi SA, in France, a small local manufacturer which includes in its portfolio 'speciality lines' such as lemon-filled organic chocolate tablets. The French company is struggling to gain ground on large manufacturers such as Ferrero and Nestlé, which have strong distribution agreements with retail chains and confectionery specialists. </p>
<p>Another small local player that could benefit from expanding its premium range into the consumer food service channel is ZPC Mieszko SA in Poland. This company focuses on the premium chocolate boxed assortments segment, and accounted for a modest 1.1% of retail value sales in Poland in chocolate confectionery in 2005. The Polish manufacturer might benefit from forging alliances with ice cream parlour chains, a foodservice format that is gaining increasing popularity among Polish consumers, as they are perceived to be a place to converse and socialise while indulging in an ice cream or other treat.</p>
<h3>Organic and fairtrade manufacturers might benefit from synergies</h3>
<p>Within Western Europe, companies specialising in organic and fairtrade chocolate confectionery might also benefit greatly from distributing or co-branding their products through coffee shops chains. One possible example of such an alliance is UK manufacturer Green & Black's, currently owned by Cadbury Schweppes and specialising in premium organic chocolate tablets. </p>
<p>Coffee chains such as Costa Coffee or Starbucks might be ideal candidates for this partnership, as both chains have made public commitments to paying a minimum price to their cocoa bean suppliers and also offer a variety of fairtrade coffee lines in their outlets. Starbucks has also sold certified organic coffee since 2000 and has gradually increased its portfolio of fairtrade products over the last few years, albeit still from a relatively small base. Meanwhile, in 2006, Costa Coffee established a foundation that will implement programmes to improve the social and economic welfare of cocoa farming communities, and offers a range of organic and fairtrade products as well.</p>
<p>Overall, Euromonitor International's research highlights that forging alliances with consumer foodservice outlets is a good strategy to increase the reach of premium and speciality confectionery suppliers. Indulgence products perfectly complement soft and hot drinks during social snacking occasions. Furthermore, consumers are usually willing to pay more for indulgence when they are going out, which makes coffee and ice cream shops ideal outlets for the expansion of premium products. </p>",373,1,173,2007-08-14 14:11:21,77729,39,2007-08-10 00:00:00,IWArticle
Suntory expands its RTD coffee business into Southeast Asia,Expansion of RTD coffee into this fast growing region reflects its corporate strategy to seek overseas markets as a main source of growth.,"<p>Expansion of RTD coffee into this fast growing region reflects its corporate strategy to seek overseas markets as a main source of growth.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Suntory, the second largest RTD coffee player in Japan, is planning to sell a range of RTD coffees (key brand Boss) in Singapore and Malaysia through cooperation with local firms. Suntory's soft drinks business is a small scale operation with a noticeable market share in China and the US only. International markets account for a mere 5% of the company's total global soft drinks value sales and the expansion of its RTD coffee business into Southeast Asia is a sign of its intention to rapidly grow its soft drinks operations.</p>
<h2>Tough domestic trading conditions</h2>
<p>Suntory's overseas expansion plan is driven by the increasingly difficult trading conditions in its domestic Japanese market and the potential prospects in Southeast Asia. Suntory has a market share of 14% by volume in Japan, far behind the market leader The Coca-Cola Company (31%). Suntory and other players such as Coca-Cola, Pokka and UCC have experienced fluctuating and declining sales over the past six years. </p>
<p>Japan is the world's largest RTD coffee market and RTD coffee is a highly saturated and established category. Its traditional target consumers are male office workers. The main factors behind its flagging sales are the ageing population and shrinking consumer base, and it has proved difficult to find new consumers and sustain sales growth. Over the past few years, manufacturers have failed to turn female consumers into RTD coffee drinkers in the face of a major assault from Starbucks (female consumers are the main patrons of Starbucks). Despite a great deal of effort having been made, overall consumption of RTD coffee has remained fairly stagnant. </p>
<h2>State of the market in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>RTD coffee is a niche product in Southeast Asia, highlighted by the fact that the total retail sales for the region are only a fraction of those in Japan. However, there is potential for growth, with Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam all predicted to record strong single-digit CAGRs between 2007 and 2011. The competitive environment is fairly consolidated across the region, with typically a few major companies controlling the majority of shares, indicative of possible opportunities for new entrants. Suntory's expansion into the region could to some extent ease the difficulties it is facing in its domestic market.</p>
<p>Thailand generates the most sales in the region, with a retail value of US$173 million in 2006, accounting for nearly 90% of regional sales. Euromonitor International believes that Thailand is an important market to crack as the country offers a ready consumer base and sizeable population.</p>
<h2>Potential challenges</h2>
<p>The main challenge is likely to be counter competition from established players. Suntory's Japanese counterparts such as Pokka and Ajinomoto are already actively marketing their products and have established their positions. For example, Ajinomoto has two subsidiaries handling its beverages business in the region: Ajinomoto Calpis Beverage (Thailand) Co Ltd and PT Ajinomoto Calpis Beverage in Indonesia. In Thailand, Ajinomoto dominates the market with a 66% share by volume and it has managed to gradually steal share from Nestlé over the past six years. In Indonesia, Ajinomoto held a 6% share in 2006, up from 4% in 2000. The competition from established players would mean potentially high marketing and promotional costs for starters. </p>
<p>Nestlé has a dominant position in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia as well as a prominent ranking in Thailand. Its flagship brand Nescafé is synonymous with instant coffee and RTD coffee in many Asian countries. Therefore, Nestlé's global strength and regional reach could potentially be a barrier to market entry. </p>
<p>Starbucks is active in both expanding its café business and launching its Discoveries chilled RTD coffee in Asia (already available in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea). A further assault on the RTD coffee category in Southeast Asia is expected. </p>
<p>Despite these barriers and challenges, Euromonitor International believes that Southeast Asia will offer great potential in the future for Suntory. </p>

There should be no surprise, therefore, that these properties look to fit well with the strong growth in energy-enhancing products, such as Red Bull, in the wider food and beverage arena.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\d14560b1-cab4-4432-9ab7-f712182587dc.jpg""><p>Energy-enhancing products have really taken off in the past few years, as illustrated by the phenomenal growth of energy drinks. Indeed with annual global volume growth averaging 17% and average volume growth in the US of 43% over the past five years this is a sector on the move. Coffee brands have the opportunity to follow up on the needs of people seeking a sustained increase in alertness and energy. Not only does this represent a new (or at least more extreme) positioning for coffee, but also the main target audience for energy drinks is made up of those consumers that coffee brands have found hardest to attract - the young - so potentially a double benefit for industry players taking a good look at this opportunity.</p>
<p>The growth in both the acceptance and prevalence of energy drinks bodes well for coffee brands aiming at this market. Witness the unabashed positioning taken by the US brand Shock Coffee. A young and irreverent image embraces all parts of the portfolio – the range includes ground coffee, whole beans, Shock-A-Cino, Shock-A-Lots (chocolate-covered hyper caffeinated coffee beans) – all with 50% more caffeine than standard coffee.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, such as with the Elite Café brand in Poland, products have been introduced with functional ingredients normally limited to energy drinks. Guarana, which contains caffeine and other alkaloids associated with stimulating the central nervous system, has been added to one of the lines of this Polish operator. However, it is not only smaller players getting in on the act. Douwe Egberts also markets its 3-in-1 Active instant coffee with guarana in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Merely noting that there is a chance to piggyback on the success of energy drinks by harnessing the natural high of coffee and adding the latest energy-boosting ingredient is not enough. It is important to remember that coffee is not ready-to-drink (unlike other energy drinks); as a result it does not necessarily fit with the faster lifestyles of today's young. Coffee manufacturers could, however, benefit from taking their brands into the RTD sector, adding their own 'natural' touch to these products (prepared and sourced in a natural way) alongside the addition of functional ingredients. On the other hand, manufacturers must also face the competition from Starbucks, so sales would need to be aimed at “non-Starbucks” areas or have a great and refreshing taste, and perhaps be positioned as an alternative to a juice or Coca-Cola, for example.</p>
<p>Any manufacturer considering a move to this sort of product needs to consider the type of promotional support required. The very attractiveness of the younger, free spending consumer means that these consumers are bombarded with advertising. They are demanding and require a confident knowing approach. Mass individuality that keeps consumers closely linked to their peers is a difficult tone to strike, but rewarding for those who succeed.</p>",432,1,37,2007-09-10 12:36:21,78122,39,2007-08-17 00:00:00,IWArticle
Innovative Indonesia shows a taste for functional coffee,"Tea has traditionally dominated the Indonesian hot drinks market. While this will undoubtedly remain the case for many years to come, coffee is on the increase and manufacturers are offering many variants in the functional coffee category.","<p>Tea has traditionally dominated the Indonesian hot drinks market. While this will undoubtedly remain the case for many years to come, coffee is on the increase and manufacturers are offering many variants in the functional coffee category.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Indonesia is one of the world's most populous countries, with nearly 250 million people, and an economy showing GDP growth of nearly 6% in 2005 (although currently challenged by rising fuel prices). The country has increasing literacy levels, a growing urban population and an increasing number of households to accommodate a population growing by around three million people every year. As a result this market is of great interest to many international operators. </p>
<p>Like in most developing economies, the concept of better-for-you products is not particularly well received by Indonesian consumers. Many cannot see the point of paying the same (or more!) for a product which effectively gives them “less”, even if the removed components are highly undesirable, such as saturated fat and/or sugar. The same principles apply to coffee, where reduced-caffeine variants have required the backing of major multinationals to gain acceptance. For the moment the immediate future for this type of product is not particularly bright and sales remain quite low. Indeed so far, sales of health and wellness fresh coffee on the whole in Indonesia have been negligible. Fresh coffee drinkers are typically of the older generation. They are loyal customers but are not so open to the concept of health and wellness fresh coffee.</p>
<p>This has not, however, stopped the decaffeinated coffee Nescafé Gold Decaf being the largest health and wellness brand in Indonesia in terms of value. But this could be challenged as manufacturers of coffee are increasingly looking at functional benefits that can be attributed to coffee brands.</p>
<p>In contrast to the general negative perception of better-for-you, fortification with additional ingredients is well received, being perceived as “good value”. Fortified/functional foods and beverages are therefore becoming increasingly popular. Among health and wellness coffee categories, fortified/functional grew the fastest at almost 18% in current value terms in 2006, largely due to new launches. Also in 2006 a prominent local company, SidoMuncul PT, introduced the SidoMuncul Kopi Ginseng brand, which is a ginseng-fortified fresh ground coffee. These brands are attempting to meet demand for fortified products from a number of fresh ground coffee drinkers. </p>
<p>The rise in popularity of these functional coffees has not only been seen in fresh coffee but also in the instant sector. Here also the industry has needed to convince consumers of their benefits. The biggest direct-selling company in Indonesia, CNI, has witnessed the sales of CNI Ginseng Coffee actually surpass those of its ginseng dietary supplements, so much so that in terms of volume sales CNI Ginseng Coffee led in health and wellness coffee in 2006 in Indonesia. While the company attributes its success mainly to its relentless innovation and emphasis on quality products, it is clear that the ever-growing number of distributors, which had reached more than 900,000 in 2006, will have helped to inform and educate consumers as to the benefits of these types of products. This success, especially in communicating the health benefits of ginseng-fortified instant coffee products to older generation consumers, prompted other companies, both local and foreign, to follow suit in 2006. Several new brands include Miwon Kopi Ginseng, and Hi Red Korean Ginseng Coffee. Unlike CNI Ginseng Coffee which relies on CNI members for promotion, Miwon Kopi Ginseng was heavily promoted via the mass media, especially television, upon its launch. </p>
<p>The long list of traditional uses for ginseng root in Indonesia includes increasing one's sense of wellbeing and stamina, improving both mental and physical performance, treating erectile dysfunction, hepatitis C, and symptoms related to the menopause, lowering blood glucose and controlling blood pressure – so it is easy to see how this medicinal root appeals to the older generation. Given its wide array of qualities in the minds of many consumers it is easy to see the potential that exists in a market of 250 million people. Having said that, ginseng is just one example of where, with sufficient advertising support and the addition of locally accepted ingredients, fortified/functional coffee and other hot beverages could do very well in Indonesia, and indeed across further markets where the acceptance of functional benefits is well established and widespread.</p>",432,1,37,2007-09-11 15:50:53,79937,39,2007-09-11 00:00:00,IWArticle
Functional coffee: a world of opportunity?,"Casting an eye across the food and beverages industry a landscape emerges that is increasingly populated by products claiming functional benefits. While the addition of functional ingredients has shown admirable growth in the packaged food arena and is prevalent in the tea market, coffee has lagged behind despite some innovative offerings around the world.","<p>Casting an eye across the food and beverages industry a landscape emerges that is increasingly populated by products claiming functional benefits. While the addition of functional ingredients has shown admirable growth in the packaged food arena and is prevalent in the tea market, coffee has lagged behind despite some innovative offerings around the world.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>With so many ailments and so many foods and drinks to treat them, coffee manufacturers can choose from a range of possible functional offerings for their products. High on the list of successful functional products are those aimed at digestive health. Probiotic yoghurt drinks is now the world's fastest-growing packaged food subsector, and consumers across a multitude of markets have become aware of digestive health issues.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of the dairy industry, the essential groundwork has already been done and coffee can get ready to do its bit for digestive health.</p>
<h3>Coffee to follow suit?</h3>
<p>Coffee manufacturers are already on the case. Consumer reaction, however, has not yet led to a rapid growth in sales. Nonetheless, we can expect this to change as the idea of functional coffee becomes more acceptable. Indeed the emergence of these products is typified by some great examples, such as Blendy Instant Oligosaccharide Coffee, available in Japan. Produced by Ajinomoto General Foods Inc (ultimately part of Kraft Foods Inc) this is a “prebiotic coffee”, which feeds the “good” bacteria in the gut. Given the mention of oligosaccharide in the brand name it is worth explaining that oligosaccharides are carbohydrates consisting of several linked sugar units (these individual units are monosaccharides). An example of an oligosaccharide is inulin, which is being used more and more as a functional ingredient in a number of food and beverage products. Oligosaccharides, such as inulin, are often also referred to as “prebiotics”. These compounds serve as a source of food for the “good” bacteria in the gut.</p>
<p>Given the recommendation from dairy brands such as Yakult and Actimel that probiotics should be enjoyed at breakfast, it seems logical to assume that coffee has an opportunity to point out that prebiotics could be consumed at the same time. So the good stuff in the yoghurt is fed by the good stuff in the coffee.</p>
<h3>Heart health</h3>
<p>Further functional opportunity resides in the area of heart health. Indeed heart-health products are everywhere, from pomegranate juice high in antioxidants to cholesterol-lowering yoghurts to omega-3 enriched bread. This health and wellness trend is beating loud and fast.</p>
<p>Coffee has traditionally received bad press as a blood-pressure-raising fiend to be avoided by those suffering from heart disease, but its bad reputation is about to turn a corner. Polyphenols are a class of plant chemicals which have been associated with heart disease and cancer prevention, as well as being attributed with anti-ageing properties. The good news for coffee manufacturers is that it is found in high concentrations in green tea and coffee. Noticeably the drive to promote this particular benefit of coffee has been focused in Asia where the ready acceptance of functional drinks means that the claims of manufacturers have found a receptive audience. Nescafé Protect is found in the Philippines and claims to have three times more antioxidants than green tea. Similarly Nestlé has launched Taster's Choice Well-Being coffee in South Korea. The brand claims to have twice as many polyphenols (ie antioxidants) as regular instant coffee.</p>
<p>The opportunities are evident in Asia, but is it a huge leap of the imagination to think that traditional coffee drinking nations could react positively to this idea? Traditional coffee-drinking cultures, such as Italy, Germany and France, could well become markets where consumers are prepared to pay a premium for coffees naturally high in antioxidants and which could potentially benefit heart health.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the immune system</h3>
<p>Another key aspect of the probiotic boom is consumers' expectations that healthy gut flora will boost their immune systems, protecting them from colds and flu. Strengthening of the immune system is a popular health and wellness concept, especially during the cold and wet autumn/winter season when sales of vitamin C and echinacea supplements soar. Echinacea (indigenous to North America) is one of the most popular immune-boosting herbs and is available in many formats such as tinctures, tablets, lozenges and teas. Once again examples in coffee exist, mostly away from the mainstream. Spava Coffee, from Voyava, can be found in the US. It offers an Immunity coffee with echinacea and rosehip, as well as other functional coffee lines.</p>
<p>The prevalence of coffee products targeting the immune system is limited, yet it seems likely that any market where sales of supplements such as echinacea are high will offer potential for such coffee. Likewise, countries where functional coffees have started to become well accepted, such as Poland, offer similar opportunities.</p>
<h3>Cognitive benefits</h3>
<p>Spava Coffee also offers Clarity coffee, with added gingko biloba and white tea. This falls into a niche of functionality based around cognitive performance and brain health. Arguably ginseng enriched coffee (such as that sold in Indonesia under the CNI Coffee brand) can be classified the same way. However, currently there are no products available seeking to latch onto the latest must-have improver of cognitive performance - omega-3.</p>
<p>The current boom in omega-3 fortification is, to a large extent, the result of increased media attention about the importance of this fatty acid on child brain development. Numerous food products have omega-3 added and a plethora of companies offer it as a dietary supplement in either capsule or liquid form. Coffee has always had positive connotations in terms of boosting mental performance, concentration and alertness, making it a natural contender for riding on this trend. Indeed microencapsulation and nanotechnology have made the addition of omega-3 to beverages possible – so why not add it to coffee?</p>
<p>Could Nestlé be considering this? Nestlé has recently declared that its major future research focus is nutrition and the brain, including the prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly. The jury is out on whether omega-3 really does have a role in fighting dementia in later life, but just like the leaf of the gingko tree has traditionally been used for treating dementia. Omega-3 has the potential to be a marketable preventative ingredient. Even if specific claims cannot be made, omega-3 is now recognised by many as potentially offering benefits to brain function; and that image is one that should be considered by manufacturers looking at the functional coffee market.</p>
<h3>When beauty is skin deep</h3>
<p>Japan and South Korea already have beauty enhancing foods and beverages. It would appear obvious that Western markets will not be far behind in considering these skin-healthy products. Consumers in these Asian early-adopter countries are already consuming antioxidant/polyphenol-rich coffees. Antioxidants have an application in skin health, keeping skin looking young and preventing wrinkles. Taking the idea further are brands such as Meiji Collagen Coffee. Collagen is one of the latest crazes in Japan. It is marketed to women who hope to slow down/reverse the ageing process (which entails the breakdown of collagen in the skin, resulting in wrinkles). So consume collagen and you look young; you are what you eat, or in this case, drink.</p>
<h3>Stressed? Have a coffee</h3>
<p>Stress alleviation is now one of the driving trends in the health and wellness market. Particularly in Western markets, increasingly hectic work schedules and often impossible-to-fulfil social and family demands are putting an enormous amount of pressure on consumers, resulting in the rise of stress-related illnesses. So in a vein opposite to points made earlier in this feature, coffee could find itself having a role in addressing this issue. </p>
<p>Already manufacturers are promoting the benefits of decaffeinated coffees. Indeed, much has been made of the success of the launch by Nestlé of Nescafé Half-Caff in the UK in 2006. But what if one further step was taken to add active functional ingredients to these decaffeinated coffees? Magnesium is a mineral which acts as a muscle relaxant and perhaps has potential. But one serious opportunity is GABA. GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, is the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter (which basically means it calms you down).</p>
<p>In Japan, beverages with added GABA are now on the rise. Interestingly, this trend appears to have started out in chocolate confectionery rather than in beverages, which is unusual for Japan. Last year, however, Lion Corp launched two tomato vinegar drinks with added GABA. Products were “designed to support the health of women living in the stressful modern world”. Moving coffee from the neutral relaxation position of decaffeinated to the overtly relaxation positioning of GABA enhanced products could be an interesting proposition for markets where sales of functional drinks and decaffeinated coffee are already high.</p>
<h3>An expanding niche</h3>
<p>Coffee has acted as the poor cousin in functional drinks terms when compared to tea. There are, however, opportunities to be exploited, but those opportunities are likely to be different for different functional offerings. Clearly, however, the rise in sales of coffee in traditional tea drinking nations (commonly used to the idea of functional beverages) suggests that functional coffee has a future. Place this thought side by side with an already growing functional coffee market in countries such as Poland, combined with the rise of functional tea sales across Western markets, and slowly we can see the possibilities for an expanding niche.</p>",432,1,37,2007-10-29 10:48:41,80037,39,2007-09-12 00:00:00,IWArticle
Sara Lee looks to grow its coffee business in emerging markets,Accelerated investments in international markets set to underpin Sara Lee's world ranking. ,"<p>Accelerated investments in international markets set to underpin Sara Lee's world ranking. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Sara Lee, ranked third in the world's coffee market by retail value, has announced its intention to extend its coffee business in high growth regions such as Latin America and Eastern Europe as these regions offer the most promising growth prospects. Euromonitor International believes that this is a significant growth strategy to drive its global sales.</p>
<h2>Development in two channels in Brazil</h2>
<p>Sara Lee is active in both retail and on-trade channels in Brazil, the world's second largest coffee market by volume. Brazil's coffee market looks set to record a retail volume CAGR of over 2% between 2007 and 2011, indicative of significant growth opportunities. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, Sara Lee's main growth strategy has been to focus on the acquisition of well-established local brands and making these brands available nationwide. The company now owns popular brands like Pilão, Café do Ponto, União, Caboclo and Seleto, which have enabled Sara Lee to defend its position in the face of stiff competition from Nestlé and Melitta. </p>
<p>Recently, the American coffee giant has changed its product strategy and started focusing on high value products. It launched Expresso Café do Ponto in sachet form in order to increase sales of its premium coffee. Currently, the new product is sold through foodservice outlets and institutions in large cities. Although the majority of Brazilian consumers are deterred by the high retail price of instant speciality coffee, the number of consumers who can afford such high-quality and convenience products is growing in tandem with the expansion of the economy. Looking ahead, Sara Lee may well explore this category further. </p>
<p>Parallel to its retail business, the company has also been capitalising on the café trend and is planning to open 100 outlets in the next few years despite the competition from other café chains such as Casa do Pao de Queijo, Frans Café and Café Pele. Sara Lee's cafés are used as a test bed for new product launches as they provide a platform for the company to have direct contact with consumers. In view of the growing café trend, Sara Lee is expected to utilise its experience and skill as a major coffee supplier to the foodservice industry and build a sound business in Brazil. </p>
<h2>Moccona a vehicle for growth in Russia </h2>
<p>With retail value sales of US$7 million, Sara Lee is a minor coffee player in Russia and ranks way behind Nestlé, Kraft and Tchibo. The company has looked to grow through the promotion of its premium Moccona line, which is available in both fresh and instant variants, and has recorded double-digit sales growth over the past six years. </p>
<p>Moccona has the advantage of strong brand recognition for its fresh coffee offerings in the Moscow area. Sara Lee is planning to focus its Russian operations on St Petersburg during the 2008 financial year before extending its reach nationwide the following year. Euromonitor International believes that Sara Lee will use Moccona as a vehicle to tap into the increased consumer demand for affordable luxuries. However, Moccona is faced with competition from other popular brands such as Nescafé Gold, Jacobs Monarch and Tchibo Exclusive. Looking forward, marketing expenditure for Moccona will need to increase if the company is to build brand awareness across the country. </p>
<p>Moreover, the large size and promising outlook (a retail volume CAGR of 6%) for the Russian coffee market has attracted substantial investment from multinationals. An increasing number of multinationals such as Nestlé and Kraft have built manufacturing facilities in Russia and started producing international brands locally. This means that the consumer price of these brands may likely be reduced, which could potentially in turn lead to a brand switch among consumers.</p>

<p>What is actually the force behind healthier products? Being good for the hair, lowering cholesterol, natural products? One of the most important concepts in health and wellness is undoubtedly slimming and weight management.</p>
<h3>Weight control</h3>
<p>The slimming and weight management concept is also a driving force in the coffee industry, as many consumers already consider coffee a stimulating, calorie-free beverage, which curbs hunger and speeds up the metabolism. But don't think the shelves are brimming over with products espousing these qualities – not yet at least.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting examples currently available is CoffeeSLENDER. Following its success in Norway, its UK manufacturer has commenced launch in the UK market. The claim of the product is to reduce glucose absorption from carbohydrates, to balance blood sugar levels and prevent cravings for sweet foods. It should be drunk after meals and then followed in turn by moderate exercise. The theory is that the drinker will burn stored fat deposits, and in turn will lose weight. </p>
<h3>Satiety</h3>
<p>Boasting alternative weight management properties is a coffee available in Australia - Bio-Vital Slimming Coffee which, amongst other functional ingredients, utilises gua gum. Gua gum is actually a common ingredient in processed foods, and is now emerging as a “satiety-enhancing” soluble fibre ingredient. Danone offers one of the more visible applications for gua gum by using it in its Lasting Satisfaction line of yoghurts, which was launched last year.</p>
<h3>Lessons to be followed from food</h3>
<p>Without doubt the opportunity for manufacturers to benefit from the consumer perception of the diet-enhancing properties of these products is huge. However, any mainstream brand is going to need a concept that is clear and understandable. The claims made and the functional ingredient used need to be well established and accepted. Therefore, closely following the successful appearance of functional products in the packaged food arena could well be a recipe for success. Alternatively, scope does always exist for the ever-elusive 'original' idea, or ingredient, that nobody else has.</p>",432,1,37,2007-10-08 08:42:04,81569,39,2007-10-08 00:00:00,IWArticle

<p>Growth at more than 8% by volume in 2006 was almost twice the rate of the global average. However, new brands have brought more competition and have led to falling unit prices and value growth below the world average. Market leaders such as P&G, Kraft Foods and Starbucks, who have been losing shares for some years, have now stirred up activities to recover their brand shares.</p>
<h3>New products and approach</h3>
<p>Starbucks has launched of a new line of limited edition Coffees to rejuvenate the brand (Starbucks® Limited Reserve and new Mild Blend). It has also introduced new products like a co-branded drinking chocolate line in partnership with Hershey's and Starbucks Coffee Liqueurs.</p>
<p>The company is also trying to increase its in-store presence through opening coffee shops within grocery stores as well as trying to changing the look and the feel of the coffee aisles at major retail outlets. The aim is to offer a unique experience in coffee shopping within the store. Premium coffee aisle decoration will include wood fixtures, coffee education displays and lighting.</p>
<p>These marketing initiatives however have limitations; loading store aisles with bright packaging and displays is by no means a guarantee to making a sale and the cost of doing this in-store will be considerable even if it is possible. Not all retailers will be happy to push the big brands ahead of their own brands in their stores.</p>
<h3>Way forward </h3>
<p>New product developments such as 'Weight controlling' lines of coffee may be introduced at a premium price to increase value. North America is one of the largest markets of weight management drinks is growing at around 6% by value (latest Euromonitor 'Better for you' beverages data) and is expected to be a good market for weight reducing coffees.</p>
<p>Manufacturers may set up vending machines in the grocery outlets or petrol forecourt outlets. Tie-ups with food chain majors would also help them reach out to the steady customer base of the food chains.</p>
<p>Smaller companies, such as Green Mountain Coffee and Second Cup Coffee Co., who have built small but steady industry positions, could become the next takeover targets for larger Cos. vying for a bigger share of the pie.</p>

Scares about bad weather in Brazil escalate coffee prices,"The growing demand for premium coffee, combined with recent speculation about supply constraints are increasing prices significantly.","<p>The growing demand for premium coffee, combined with recent speculation about supply constraints are increasing prices significantly.</p>

<p>Brazil produces over 30% of the world's coffee beans, which are primarily the superior quality, Arabica beans which are mostly sold mostly to the US and other developed markets. This year however, the annual rains are later than usual and the worlds largest global suppler is anticipating a harvest shortfall. The gloomy forecast has already prompted P&G to announce a 10% increase in prices for the Folgers ground coffee brand, and other manufacturers are likely to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Future is not too gloomy</h3>
<p>The price increases are forcing coffee manufacturers/retailers to evaluate other supply options. Top of the list is Vietnam, which despite mostly producing lower quality Robusta coffee beans is already encouraging growers to tighten quality control standards, particularly for the premium varieties of Robusta beans in anticipation of the growing demand.</p>
<p>Manufacturers should look to develop new blends using a higher proportion of Robusta beans to create new premium coffee products in the short term. These products maybe marketed as limited edition coffees to generate customer interest and justify price hikes rather than discouraging purchases.</p>
<h3>Dealing with price increases</h3>
<p>Price increases backed up by advertising sustainable ingredients sourcing and 'fair-trade' concepts will be used to balance falling volumes in economy brands. The retail sales of fair-trade coffee grew nearly ten times in five years (2001 to 2006) in US. It is also the fastest growing segment in the US$22 billion coffee industry. The growing popularity of fair-trade coffee shows that consumers will overlook a minor price increase in the price of their favourite cup of coffee for this cause. </p>
<p>Health concerns along with high prices would be the primary reasons for consumers trying to drink less coffee. Since price increase seems inevitable marketers should strongly try to communicate health benefits of coffee to arrest volume decline.</p>

Coffee majors look to India for sourcing scarce Arabica,"India, the fifth largest exporter of coffee beans, is set to become a major global source of Arabica beans after worries about prolonged dry weather in Brazil (the world's largest producer) have driven the price up to an 8-year high of over US$3 per kilogram.","<p>India, the fifth largest exporter of coffee beans, is set to become a major global source of Arabica beans after worries about prolonged dry weather in Brazil (the world's largest producer) have driven the price up to an 8-year high of over US$3 per kilogram.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Brazil is expected to produce a significantly smaller crop this year compared to last. The second largest coffee producer, Vietnam, continues to face quality issues despite primarily producing the standard quality Robusta beans, and has also suffered two consecutive years of poor harvests.</p>
<p>In spite of these production problems, demand for premium Arabica beans is set to continue to rise due to the growing popularity of gourmet coffee across the globe. Major coffee manufacturers such as Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble and Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA have already increased prices of their roasted coffees by 7-8%, speculating on further supply constraints for both Robusta and Arabica beans.</p>
<h3>Good harvests predicted in India</h3>
<p>India's Arabica harvest in 2007/08 is forecast to be better than that of 2006/07. India produces only 4.5% of global coffee but exports 70-80% of its output, of which close to 40% is Arabica. Most of the coffee is sold direct to Russia and European countries, of which Italy accounts for a quarter.</p>
<p>As the global demand for premium coffee increases, Italian companies such as Illycaffé and Lavazza have increasingly used Indian Arabica beans, along with some South American Arabica, for their finest premium blends. Italian coffee blends across the world, and particularly in the US, have proven very popular recently, with market share growing in almost every major regional market.</p>
<p>Indian exports to Italy have grown by around 35% over the last five years and the country is now the source of 2,500 tonnes of Arabica beans for Illycaffé annually and also provides one eighth of Lavazza's requirements. More recently, Starbucks has started sourcing Arabica beans from India.</p>
<h3>Indian coffee to ease price pressure</h3>
<p>The Indian domestic price of Arabica beans is around 14% below the international market price due to very little marketing and consumers being unaware of different varieties of coffee. Coffee manufacturers have now realised they can buy high-quality raw Indian Arabica beans cheaply, directly from the growers, which can only lead to major growth in India as some traditional suppliers are suffering from poor harvests.</p>
<p>The lower raw material cost will not only increase profits; choosing premium coffee by origin is already a primary factor for European coffee drinkers and already one of the current Italian coffee favourites is the Indian 'Monsoon Cafe'. Lower costs, combined with the potential to premiumise 'Indian source' coffees, might also help manufacturers charge more of a premium, propping up value sales while facing a potential drop in volumes.</p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Currently, growing demand and fears of a low Arabica harvest in Brazil (the largest global producer), have stirred up the coffee market and led to an increase in prices of raw as well as roasted coffee beans.</p>
<p>India is the fifth largest producer of coffee and has been supplying raw beans to renowned companies like Illycaffé, Lavazza and Starbucks. Indian coffee has gained considerable popularity in European countries and some coffee connoisseurs are choosing coffee by its Indian origin. Monsoon Café is one of the favourites.</p>
<p>The new coffee variety is known for its high yields and higher resistance to all common varieties of rust (plant disease), which in turn means very low usage of pesticides. Steps are also being taken to minimise cross-pollination with other varieties, which might weaken the new variety. This would ensure higher standards of 'organicness' and more assured harvests than other coffee crops, which are sometimes extensively damaged by borers, which can lead to a huge divergence in expectations and actual yields.</p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and PepsiCo have announced their intention to expand their global RTD coffee businesses through extended business agreements with their coffee partners. Euromonitor International believes that this increased investment from the cola giants will certainly facilitate the growth of the category which is currently worth US$9.4 billion. </p>
<h3>Coca-Cola keen on RTD coffee </h3>
<p>Coca-Cola and the Italian coffee specialist Illycaffé SpA intend to jointly develop premium RTD coffee by leveraging Illycaffé's expertise in the espresso category and Coca-Cola's brand building and distribution expertise. Unbeknown to many consumers, Coca-Cola's Georgia brand leads the world's RTD coffee category and the company has huge experience in developing a variety of RTD coffee products on its own, although this experience is mainly confined to the saturated Japanese market. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola's bottlers, however, do have the experience in handling RTD coffee products (Nescafé) under the Beverage Partners Worldwide agreement and this will give the Coca-Cola/Illycaffé deal a solid platform on which to build. Both Coca-Cola and its bottlers are eager to diversify their products in light of the slowdown in carbonates.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola's ambitions in RTD coffee are also reflected in the fact that it acquired the market rights in China to RTD Nescafé (the only truly global RTD coffee brand) from Nestlé in 2005. Moreover, the changed terms of  the BPW  has given Coca-Cola the flexibility to develop its own RTD coffee business. Euromonitor International believes that Coca-Cola is becoming an underlying threat to Nestlé and certain Japanese players.</p>
<h2>Illycaffé needs new consumers </h2>
<p>Illycaffé is one of the fastest growing second-tier coffee specialists in the global coffee market thanks to its strength in espresso. Specifically, the company has not only doubled its retail value sales but has also successfully expanded its global geographical coverage over the past six years. In the competitive domestic Italian market, Illycaffé has managed to increase its retail value sales and make share gains, evidence of the company's strong organic growth and viability of the Illy brand. </p>
<p>However, Illycaffé remains an insignificant coffee player compared to true multinationals such as Nestlé, Kraft and Sara Lee. It needs to strategically diversify its product lines in order to expose the brand to new consumer segments. The alliance with Coca-Cola would give it a chance to achieve this goal although the specifics on brands and distribution have not yet been finalised.</p>
<h2>PepsiCo and Starbucks working beyond North America</h2>
<p>PepsiCo's RTD coffee business is heavily involved in a partnership with Starbucks. The two parties have announced that they are expanding their relationship beyond North America and will also look to countries that may not currently have Starbucks outlets. The first country to benefit from the extended deal is said to be greater China where Starbucks has 540 stores. Apart from this global deal, PepsiCo's regional subsidiaries have also increased their activities in RTD coffee. For example, PepsiCo has agreed to distribute Suntory's RTD coffee in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>RTD coffee remains largely an untapped category in many parts of the world, although a growing number of major beverage players such as Sara Lee and Emmi have increased their investments. Euromonitor International believes that the growing involvement of the cola giants will positively drive growth of the category and raise the product profile to a new level.</p>

Potential impact of coffee price hike,Cushioning the drop in margins or maintaining market share is a continuous challenge for mainstream players in the short to medium term.,"<p>Cushioning the drop in margins or maintaining market share is a continuous challenge for mainstream players in the short to medium term.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Several global coffee majors including Procter & Gamble, Kraft and Dunkin' Donuts have announced their intention to implement consumer price increases in response to significantly increased year-to-date coffee prices (approximately 25% year-to-date and 40% year-on-year). The price hike has also filtered through to third-tier coffee specialist, US-based Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which is set to increase prices across its entire product portfolio, its first rise since 2005. Euromonitor International believes that the current pricing strategy may offset some of the input costs in the short term. However, it may harm market shares in the medium to long term.</p>
<h3>Good for the balance sheet but unfavourable to market share</h3>
<p>With higher raw material costs, gross profit margin and general financial health will be based upon the ability to offset the sharp rise in commodity prices. Passing on the extra input costs to consumers can generally ease the pressure on margins. While the price increases may make the balance sheets more pleasant to review and please the City analysts, they may have an adverse impact on the market shares of branded coffee players, particularly those majors with high earnings in developed coffee nations such as the US and Western Europe where manufacturers had already found it hard to increase consumer price on the back of market maturity.</p>
<p>In Germany, the competition between private label and branded coffee, such as Kraft's flagship brand Jacobs, is obviously tense and the stagnant share performance of the latter over the past few years is evidence of this. Specifically, private label has made significant inroads in market share, rising from 18% in 2000 to 23% in 2007. Coffee is a staple beverage and consumers are not expected to reduce or stop consuming coffee completely in the short term. The majority of consumers may choose to stick to private label or actually start to trade down to private label offerings. Consequently, this has the potential to negatively affect the volume sales and market share of branded coffee. </p>
<p>Similarly, Kraft has been struggling in the competitive US coffee market and has experienced consecutive drops in market share over the past seven years. Euromonitor International believes that the price increase is not going to add significant benefit to the share performance in 2008. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, supermarkets and their contract manufacturers may not want to swallow the input costs and are taking similar actions in these current conditions. However, the levels of their increases are not expected to match those of the mainstream brands as supermarkets ultimately aim at keeping prices down, which is their overriding competitive edge. </p>
<p>To combat these tough trading conditions, branded manufacturers will need to work hard on their premium product portfolios to differentiate themselves from mid-range and private label offerings. On the one hand, they can openly command a higher unit price while on the other they can try to encourage some consumers to trade up. Highlighting the premiumisation trend, Kraft recently introduced premium Jacobs Sinnfonie coffee in Germany, targeting coffee drinkers looking for an indulgent experience, and therefore the company has actively looked to expand its brand portfolio to incorporate premium offerings. In short, the balancing act between margins and market share will be a continuous challenge.</p>

Mexico’s coffee sector identified as attractive for NPD,Mexico is the seventh largest coffee producer in the world but ranks only 16th in terms of coffee consumption.,"<p>Mexico is the seventh largest coffee producer in the world but ranks only 16th in terms of coffee consumption.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>There is nothing unusual about this disparity. In fact, of the leading coffee producers in the world only Brazil (second) and Indonesia (ninth) rank in the top 10 in terms of consumption. The reality is that coffee is a commodity produced mainly in the developing world, where purchasing power has tended to be too low to fuel a significant domestic market. However, a growing number of developing countries are starting to show greater macroeconomic stability and as disposable income grows so too will domestic demand for local coffee. In its latest Hot Drinks presentation, available in April, Euromonitor International identifies Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, all coffee producing countries, as five of the top 10 growth markets for hot coffee over the next five years; and Mexico, in particular, is viewed as one of the world's most attractive markets for new product development. </p>
<p>According to Euromonitor International, consumption of coffee in Mexico totalled around 61,612 tonnes in 2007, an increase of 3.6% on 2006. Instant coffee, which accounted for 37.5% of this volume, registered its third consecutive year of contraction. On the upside, fresh coffee posted its second consecutive year of double-digit growth and by 2012, fresh coffee is forecast to account for around 75% of total coffee demand compared with 47% in 2005. Indeed, growth of fresh coffee between 2007 and 2012 is projected at 62.3% while instant formats are expected to continue to decline. So what is happening in Mexico that is so radically affecting the make up of the local coffee market? At the core of the trend is a vibrant new café culture that is plain to see for anyone visiting the middle-class neighbourhoods of Mexico City, Monterrey or Guadalajara, and at the centre of this on-trade dynamism is Starbucks, which is opening new outlets in Mexico at a rate of between six and seven a month. </p>
<p>Mexico's first Starbucks opened in 2002 and expansion was initially gradual, with on average one new store popping up every month. At the end of February 2008, Alsea, the Mexican company operating the Starbucks franchise, reported 201 Starbucks coffee stores in Mexico compared with 120 for the same period a year earlier. At least 80 new stores are planned for the next 12-month cycle and in a country that comprises 75 cities with a population in excess of 100,000 and nine cities with a population in excess of one million there is plenty more room for growth. This is good news for Starbucks, which has started to see sluggish activity in its home US market. In Mexico, the rapid rate of expansion is being fuelled by a burgeoning middle class, which is proving to be increasingly receptive to sophisticated retail and foodservice culture. While you can expect Mexico to be hit by some form of contagion from a US recession it is also safe to say that the economic fundamentals are now much stronger than a decade ago and there seems little doubt that its new generation of middle-class professionals will continue to grow in size.</p>
<p>All of which is positive pressure for the local coffee market and over the next five years there will be important opportunities for new product development, particularly in terms of gourmet brands, new flavour mixes and new packaging. The argument is that as Mexico's emerging ranks of upwardly mobile trendsetters get used to their cappuccinos and espressos in the on-trade channel, they will start to demand a greater range and supply of premium fresh coffee formats for consumption at home. For the instant category, the prognosis is not so good because it tends to lack the sophistication factor that is driving this new demand. This means that Nestlé, the dominant player in the instant coffee category with a share of around 75%, will need to up its game or face losing substantial ground. The launch last year of its Protect brand, which claims to provide more antioxidants than traditional green tea, is evidence that the company is aware of the need to diversify and reinvigorate its instant coffee portfolio; however, this brand is probably too niche to make much of a wave in a sector that is increasingly out of favour. Right now the impetus is very much with fresh coffee and that is where Euromonitor International expects the smart money to be invested in Mexico over the short to medium term.</p>

Vietnamese coffee powerhouse Trung Nguyen sets its sights abroad,"Already a dominant force in its home market, Vietnam's Trung Nguyen Coffee Company has taken the first steps towards establishing a global presence","<p>Already a dominant force in its home market, Vietnam's Trung Nguyen Coffee Company has taken the first steps towards establishing a global presence</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The company moved to launch coffee shops in Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, and Japan, while also working to raise the international profile of Vietnam's coffee industry. </p>
<p>One of the first franchised operations to find success in Vietnam, Trung Nguyen's network of cafes has grown to more than 650 outlets across the country, while the company's lines of fresh ground and instant coffee now account for more than 30% of total retail sales in Vietnam. Alongside a small number of Trung Nguyen cafes now operating outside of Vietnam, the company has begun selling branded retail coffees in foreign markets; at the same time, it continues to work to improve the perception of robusta coffee, long considered inferior to arabica beans in terms of taste, yet accounting for the vast majority of Vietnam's (and, by extension, Trung Nguyen's) coffee output. </p>
<h3>Vertical integration, franchising drive sales at home</h3>
<p>Formed in 1996 as a small coffee processing operation in central Vietnam, Trung Nguyen grew quickly through a no-frills franchising policy; for a one-time fee and an agreement to buy only Trung Nguyen coffee, any entrepreneur could operate under the Trung Nguyen brand, an important innovation in a market where branding of any kind was still rare. Over the last ten years, this has provided ample capital for expansion, though it has also spawned issues with quality control and, in some cases, outright fraud—it is believed that dozens of shops currently operate under the Trung Nguyen name, despite no formal connection to the company. </p>
<p>Despite this, franchising has proven an enormously effective marketing tool, while also allowing the company to continuously upgrade its production facilities and product lines. In 2003, the Trung Nguyen rolled out Tra Tien, its first tea line, followed shortly afterwards by G7, its first-ever branded instant coffee product, now the number three instant coffee in Vietnam behind market leaders Vinacafe and Nescafe. In 2006, the company announced the formation of G7 Mart, a network of convenience stores operating throughout the country. With 655 outlets open by the end of 2007, the new stores give Trung Nguyen a sales and distribution network which no other private competitor can match. </p>
<h3>International markets the next frontier</h3>
<p>While sales in Vietnam are projected to expand steadily, the company has also set its sights abroad, looking to build awareness among far more affluent developed-market consumers. Alongside cafes in Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and Cambodia, Trung Nguyen has established a limited distribution network in markets such as the US, mostly in stores catering to the local Vietnamese community. In addition, Trung Nguyen coffees can be purchased online in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Much of the company's marketing strategy hinges on establishing Vietnamese coffee as a recognized brand, as has been done with the coffees of Kenya, Colombia, and elsewhere. Hampering these efforts is Trung Nguyen's dependence on robusta beans, derided by many as inferior in taste to arabica beans. To counter this, the company has established websites in major markets extolling the virtues of robusta and other lesser-known varieties, arguing they offer unique flavours not present in arabica-heavy blends. Likewise, the websites notes the ominous consequences of an arabica monoculture, claiming a lack of biodiversity could prove devastating in the event of a large-scale disease or pest outbreak. </p>
<h3>Rising competition, tough global markets a huge challenge going forward</h3>
<p> Trung Nguyen's plans to conquer the global market could prove overly ambitious; the company faces any number of better-known and far better-funded competitors, and convincing global consumers of the robusta bean's charms could take years, if it ever happens at all. Even the company's name could prove an obstacle to a wider market—while “Nguyen” is easily the most common Vietnamese surname, its pronunciation is by no means intuitive for most non-Vietnamese speakers. </p>
<p>While Trung Nguyen's position in its home market is secure in the short-term, with the company expected to benefit from continuing expansion in coffee consumption over the next five years, competition is heating up. High tariffs on imported coffee and a protected retail market have helped keep Trung Nguyen's profits strong; both are expected to be scaled back significantly following Vietnam's recent accession to the WTO. What's more, rising disposable incomes and an established urban coffee-drinking culture are sure to eventually attract the attention of specialist coffee shop chains such as Starbucks or Japan's Doutor. </p>
<p>That said, any chain looking to set up shop in Vietnam will face a well-entrenched competitor, one with a recognised brand and a powerful distribution system. What's more, Trung Nguyen could well find a profitable niche overseas, as increasingly sophisticated global coffee consumers continue to seek out new flavours and blends. </p>",1535,1,417,2008-04-21 11:07:43,92954,39,2008-04-09 00:00:00,IWArticle

","<p>Global consumption of RTD coffee is weaker than any other soft drinks category. Hence, the newly confirmed global joint venture agreement between The Coca-Cola Company and Italy's Illycaffè Spa is, on paper, a risk. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>However, Euromonitor International believes that the potential for high returns over the medium to long term make it a risk worth taking.</p>
<h3>The risk</h3>
<p>According to Euromonitor International's latest available data, the total (rsp) value of the world's RTD coffee market reached around US$11.2 billion in 2007, with volume running to some 2.9 billion litres. To put this in context, global consumption of carbonated soft drinks is around 69 times higher and even RTD tea, itself a niche category, is over seven times higher. The opening gambit of the new Coke/Illycaffè alliance (known as Ilko Coffee International) is to introduce three premium RTD coffee brands into a range of European markets this month. Some of these markets, such as Ukraine, do not currently have an RTD coffee sector. Hence, the brands will effectively be launching a brand new category and hoping to bring on stream a new generation of consumers with negligible understanding of the concept of RTD coffee. In terms of NPD difficulty factor, this is at the summit of the scale. In fact, Germany is currently the only European market to figure in the top 10 RTD coffee markets in the world and there were only 10 European markets that broke the one million litre consumption mark in 2007.</p>
<p>Given there is nothing especially trailblazing about RTD coffee in Europe it might seem a bad time to be raising the tempo. Crucially, the riskier Eastern European markets chosen for the new RTD coffee brands are currently experiencing significant growth in hot coffee consumption, fuelled by vibrant on-trade activity. It will be a tough nut to crack, but if Ilko's brands are given the right support, and Coca-Cola has the distribution muscle and know-how to provide it, they can piggyback this growing middle-class demand for gourmet coffee. Certainly it would be a mistake to ignore the dynamism of Eastern Europe's café culture because fast growing on-trade venues could provide an ideal promotional springboard for the premium RTD coffee format. Furthermore, the three brands in question – Caffè, Cappuccino and Latte Macchiato – are each packaged in stylish metal cans (150ml and 200ml), so they have sophistication potential that should appeal to Europe's newest generation of trendsetters. These are definitely products to be seen with, not simply to be consumed at home. </p>

<h3>The opportunity</h3>
<p>It is also important that the brands are coming on stream at the onset of the European summer because this is the critical consumption period for the RTD coffee format. In fact, the next four months could make or break these brands because they will need positive momentum to propel them through the less favourable winter consumption period. If the brands perform well, they are expected to come on stream next year in a wide range of world markets, utilising the Coca-Cola bottling system. The important point is that these brands have a premium positioning, so they have excellent opportunity to yield attractive volume-value profitability. Indeed, RTD coffee might currently be miles behind other soft drinks categories in terms of consumption demand but industry players should expect to see a good game of catch-up over the next 10 years, especially as some of the higher volume sectors of the industry grow weary and as beverage tastes become evermore sophisticated. The Coca-Cola Company rarely bets on losers, and investment at the top end of the RTD coffee category could well turn out to be one of the smartest places to be. </p>

<p>Coffee blended with cat droppings is a headline-grabbing concept, but do not expect to see this product in your local supermarket. If you want to buy a cat dung espresso or cappuccino you should head to the Espresso Bar in Peter Jones department store (Chelsea, London), and one hit will set you back about the same price as a decent bottle of champagne. This is believed to be the most expensive coffee in the world and is off the radar for most consumers. However, there is an important point to be gleaned here in that niche-focused premium gourmet brands are likely to become an important driver of on-trade fresh coffee consumption over the next five years and could sharpen the growth curve of the category as a whole. According to Euromonitor International, the global fresh coffee market posted value growth (US dollars) of 3.9% in 2007, its weakest performance of the past five years. Given that café culture is set to grow in some of the world's key emerging markets of Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, there has never been a better time to invest in premium gourmet coffee and push this growth rate north. Equally, some of the world's under-performing developed markets, such as France, Germany and Italy, would welcome an injection of upscale innovation and novelty.</p>

<p>The contagion of the credit crunch is likely to spread over the coming year; however, top range brands tend to be more recession-proof than other price categories. Companies, therefore, should not be afraid to invest in this high-end arena, because quite simply there are enough fat salaries in urban centres from Moscow to Mexico City to ensure a market for super-premium beverages. Indeed, the issue is less about price and more about the quality of the innovation and, in many markets, the kudos of the sophistication credentials. Companies need to look at the new generation of upwardly mobile professionals in specific emerging markets (such as Russia, Mexico, China and Ukraine) and leverage from their growing taste for Western-style sophistication and all-things premium. In that context, novelty is a viable strategic route for new product development in the fresh coffee category provided that it is synchronised with fast-evolving fashions and lifestyle choices. The problem with novelty is that it can be high risk, and by definition it is also transitory. But the fresh coffee market has an opportunity to build on the momentum created by coffee parlour chains such as Starbucks and it needs to embrace it. Cat dung coffee is ultra-niche and at the very top of the super-premium ladder. While it is unlikely to appear on the menu at Starbucks, it is relevant as a unique and exclusive brand concept. The crucial point is that there is growing demand for high-end brands in the fast-growth emerging markets and coffee manufacturers need to stake their claim. </p>
<p>Note: All profits from the sale of Caffe Raro at Peter Jones in Sloane Square, London, will go to Macmillan Cancer Research. </p>

Although total volume sales in South Korea are predicted to slow down in the short term, Euromonitor International identifies the immediate opportunities for premium RTD coffee and the subsequent added value that products can offer. Forthcoming new product developments and product launches are likely to take place within the premium segment, which can invigorate the RTD coffee category in both volume and value terms over the medium term. </p>
<h3>Rise of premium brands </h3>
<p>As one of the most industrialised Asian countries, South Korea has relatively high coffee consumption at 1kg per head, compared to average per capita consumption of 0.2kg in Asia-Pacific as a whole. The widespread penetration of coffee in the country means a there is already a potentially solid consumer base for coffee-related beverages. Moreover, increased income levels in tandem with rapid economic growth make premium RTD coffee an affordable drink for many of Korea's younger consumers. In comparison, China (volume CAGR of 10% over 2007-2012) and Indonesia (16%) may see a much higher growth in the long run, however this will unfortunately require substantial investment to harness any potential value return.</p>
<p>Starbucks has been actively promoting its premium RTD coffee to Korean consumers, launching Doubleshot and Discoveries in recent years. Local company Namyang Dairy Products Co Ltd, the second largest player in premium RTD coffee, has also stepped up its marketing activities recently. The company launched a new advertising campaign in 2006 to support its brand French Café, which has recorded consistently rising sales over the past seven years. </p>
<h3>What does the future hold?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, major RTD coffee players in the region, such as Suntory and Ajinomoto and UCC, who have increased their investments in Southeast Asia, may look for opportunities in the Korean market in the short to medium term. In addition, The Coca-Cola Company, global market leader for RTD coffee, recently finalized the deal with the Italian coffee specialist Illycafe and the company is showing keen interest in the premium RTD coffee category. It would come as no surprise if the Korean market is targeted by a premium RTD coffee range, especially as the main global value market of Japan is beginning to show signs of stagnation. Therefore, it is conceivable that there will be a global push from RTD coffee players in the Asian region in the not too distant future. </p>",393,1,417,2008-05-09 17:02:07,93700,39,2008-04-21 00:00:00,IWArticle

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>There is, however, a silver lining, with Euromonitor International forecasting significant growth curves for Russia, the Philippines and Italy, with each ranking in the global top 10 markets by volume. </p>
<p>Outside the top 10 countries, strong growth is also forecast for second- and third-tier markets as wide ranging as Ukraine, Morocco, the Czech Republic, Argentina and Saudi Arabia, while in terms of decaffeinated fresh coffee the key forecast growth engine is identified as Mexico. Crucially, Euromonitor International believes that industry players should continue to view decaffeinated coffee as a value-enhancing niche category for the long term, not least because trends in coffee consumption tend to be cyclical and, subject to intelligent promotional activity, the category still has the credentials to piggyback a growing trend towards better-for-you beverages. In fact, notwithstanding the poor outlook on paper, there has arguably never been a better time to invest in new product activity. </p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenote"">Volume is for the total market in tonnes</p>
<p>Identifying the consumer is critical to the success of the category, especially in terms of the promotional agenda. It is perhaps no surprise that the ageing demographics of Spain, the US, the UK, Russia, Japan, Italy and France collectively fuel the lion's share of the global market, given that demand is comparatively higher among older people, especially women, and notably those who have more trouble sleeping. However, going forward, the goal of leading players should be to bring on stream a wider range of consumers, young and old. Herein lies one of the core problems because people who consume decaffeinated coffee tend not to consume caffeinated formats, and vice versa. Euromonitor International believes that the biggest marketing challenge confronting the category is to get mainstream full-strength coffee aficionados to perceive decaffeinated coffee as a hot beverage that has its own unique consumption occasions. Such occasions would logically be nocturnal, but equally they could fall during the working day, for example as breaks between cups of caffeine hits, which for many of us are all too frequent. In short, health savvy consumers in urban environments around the world are likely to come into the category more readily if they understand decaffeinated as a complement to their daily intake of full-strength coffee, rather than as a substitute. Pregnant women are also identified as an attractive niche consumer base for the product and should be a sharper focus of promotional investment going forward. </p>
<h3>Acquisition of Folgers</h3>
<p>Folgers, the target last week of a US$3.3 billion all-stock buy out by JM Smucker, spearheads the decaffeinated category in the US market. One of the reasons Procter & Gamble has been seeking a buyer for Folgers is that growth across its coffee portfolio has been sluggish and failing to meet goals. The decaffeinated brand has been no exception to the underperformance, with volume sales sliding year-on-year since 2000, according to data from Euromonitor International. Given the right type of investment and promotional initiative, there is no reason why the Folgers decaffeinated brand should not return to growth over the medium term. Competitive positioning and strong distribution will be central to strategic development, but it could prove even more rewarding to re-educate the consumer on new consumption occasions and the benefits of complementing full-strength coffee with decaffeinated. Initially this might be as tough a nut to crack as selling meat to vegetarians because for many people the consumption preference of decaffeinated over caffeinated is that black and white. A shift in consumer perception will be a gradual process, which is why investment needs to commit to the long term. Ultimately, if brands are to meet the challenge, the category as a whole might need to be wholly revamped. </p>
<p>The US is forecast to be a reluctant growth engine over the next five years, but the category undeniably has potential to become a key value driver into the future. Keep in mind that decaffeinated coffee was all the rage in the 1990s, and yet the operating environment for the product is in fact more favourable now than it was then, with middle- income consumers looking increasingly at ways to eat and drink more conscientiously. A decade from now and this trend will likely have become even more consolidated. For industry players eyeing up short-term gains, investment strategies should focus on a range of first- and second-tier emerging markets where the decaffeinated category needs to stake its claim to a growing hot coffee consumption culture. In Russia, middle-income urban women are identified as key drivers of demand going forward, while away from the BRICs, the Philippines could yield healthy returns on investment in decaffeinated instant coffee because there is a swelling culture for convenience products, of which instant coffee is a visible beneficiary. In this market, the key to developing the decaffeinated category will be wider availability of brands and more competitive positioning. In summary, the forecast consumption figures for decaffeinated coffee might paint a gloomy picture globally, but drilling down into the key growth markets and understanding the reasons why the category has been failing in developed markets should be understood as critical first steps to a long-term recovery.</p>

<p>With Coca-Cola's Full Throttle Coffee rolling out next month in the US, hot on the heels of Doubleshot Energy + Coffee from Starbuck's/PepsiCo. Euromonitor International believes that coffee mixed with energy drinks could develop as a niche, value-enhancing sub-category over the medium term, raising the competitive tempo in all categories of the functional market, but warns that the concept is likely to yield the best results if it evolves directly from energy drinks, rather than from RTD coffee. </p>

<h3>Engaging the consumer</h3>
<p>Energy drinks was the fastest growing soft drinks category in the world last year and volume is going nowhere but up, with global compound annual growth projected at 7.5% over 2007-2012, according to the latest available data from Euromonitor International. However, the fickle nature of consumption means that brands can often disappear from the market overnight. The challenge, therefore, is to keep consumers engaged. Segmentation or brand spin-offs can effectively achieve this end, but it is a risky strategy because new formats have potential to fall flat on their face and also, by way of contagion, to derail the pulse of a brand's portfolio. In the case of Full Throttle, the brand's current line extensions comprise Original, Unleaded, Blue Demon and Fury. The problem with these extensions is that they each have strong potential to cannibalise volume one from the other. The introduction of Full Throttle Coffee, blended using 100% Colombian Arabica coffee and Full Throttle's energy and vitamin brand, is identified as a smarter investment, because first and foremost the flavour concept of the drink immediately distinguishes it from the rest of the portfolio. From the outset it is, therefore, much less likely to erode volume within the Full Throttle family. And crucially, this latest Full Throttle spin-off does not stray too far from the brand's founding heritage. Indeed, it aligns seamlessly with the 'fully charged' image that sits at the crux of the brand's marketing activity. </p>

<h3>The heritage of a brand</h3>
<p>All too often, leveraging a brand name to break into a new segment can backfire, no matter how much money is thrown behind a launch (See Euromonitor comment Red Bull on a hiding to nothing with cola entry). Coca-Cola appears to have got it right with Full Throttle Coffee because it will be easy for Full Throttle's traditional fan base to identify with the brand while the coffee concept will appeal to RTD coffee aficionados too. However, the same cannot necessarily be said of Starbuck's/PepsiCo's Doubleshot Energy + Coffee, which has arrived at the same functional concept, but from the starting point of RTD coffee. Rather, it should be viewed as a riskier spin-off for the simple reason that the heritage of Starbuck's is so firmly entrenched in coffee culture. In fact, the founder of the chain, Howard Schultz, recently hinted that the lack of coffee aroma wafting from Starbuck's coffee houses could be a reason behind the recent underperformance of outlets in the US. In other words, the development of food and non-coffee beverages within the Starbuck's business, while on paper seeming to add value, might in fact have undermined the core heritage of the brand. This is exactly the issue facing the chain's energy-infused coffee drink; specifically, the concept is a good idea on paper but the brand itself could weaken rather than strengthen the way consumers perceive the Starbuck's heritage. </p>
<p>The heritage argument is open to debate and only time will tell which of the brands, Pepsi/Starbuck's Doubleshot Energy + Coffee or Coca-Cola's Full Throttle Coffee, comes out on top. What seems clear is that the energy drinks sector, in particular, is under enormous pressure to innovate. Equally, the attractive growth story of the sector is hugely appealing and beverage players from wine and spirits producers to coffee manufacturers are keen to get a piece of the action. The window of opportunity might be vast, but getting into the sector and consolidating a position has a very high difficulty factor. Indeed, coming up with an innovative new spin on a concept is not on its own enough. Crucially, innovation needs to be aligned with a brand's heritage and if that component is missing, the downside implications can be serious. </p>

Thailand to hit top spot in instant coffee by 2012,"Thailand is forecast to become the first country in the world to consume more than 100 million tonnes of instant coffee in one year, according to the latest data from Euromonitor International.","<p>Thailand is forecast to become the first country in the world to consume more than 100 million tonnes of instant coffee in one year, according to the latest data from Euromonitor International.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>This would constitute a remarkable growth trajectory, with volume more than tripling over a decade. A new generation of coffee drinkers has emerged at the heart of Thailand's growth story, notably college students and young middle-class professionals. Many of these new consumers come from the country's main urban centres, but industry leader Nestlé has also channelled significant marketing and promotional investment into provincial regions of the country, thereby broadening the core consumer base. This was a bold strategy and is a relevant benchmark for industry players operating in the emerging markets. Specifically, companies in developing countries are often too risk-averse, preferring to focus promotional investment within the comfort zone of key urban areas rather than maximising opportunities in lower-impact regions. Nestlé's successful penetration into Thailand's provinces shows that higher-risk marketing initiatives, typically off the beaten track, can result in very attractive returns on investment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Investment opportunities in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Fuelled by its aggressive cross-country marketing programme, Nestlé posted double-digit volume growth in Thailand for five consecutive years from 2003 to 2007. However, by leveraging on Nestlé's investment in the category as a whole, local player Khao Shong managed to put up an even stronger performance, with its annual growth running at over 20% by volume during the same period. Khao Shong was the instant coffee category's third ranked company in 2007, holding a share of 10.3% against Nestlé's 54.7%. Euromonitor International believes that Khao Shong will continue to generate strong volume growth into the medium term and that the company is on track to dethrone Super Coffeemix as the number two instant coffee player in the country. For multinational players looking at global investment opportunities, Khao Shong could prove an attractive acquisition target, especially if it expands its business model outside Thailand and secures a firm foothold in Southeast Asia. </p>

<p>There is a growing convenience consumption culture taking shape across Southeast Asia and this is driving positive results in the instant coffee category. Indeed, both Indonesia and the Philippines ranked in the world's top 10 markets for instant coffee in 2007 and, according to Euromonitor International, the world's top three growth markets for instant coffee between 2007 and 2012 will all come from the Southeast Asia region, namely Indonesia (+137.9%), Vietnam (+84.2%) and Thailand (+65.7%). Conversely, the US is forecast to see the global market's most precipitous slide in volume (-16%), with its consumers shifting increasingly to fresh coffee. </p>
<p>Windows of opportunity tend not to stay open for long, so industry players should be clear that there has never been a better time to invest in Southeast Asia's instant coffee market. Innovative new product development will be important and for acquisition-hungry investors looking at an attractive medium-term growth bet, Khao Shong could be bang on the money. The time to act is now. </p>

<p>Saying in a press statement that it was “the most angst-ridden decision we have made in my more than 25 years with Starbucks”. Euromonitor International assesses the implications of this enforced slowdown in the chain's home market. </p>
<p>Angst-ridden the decision might have been, but first and foremost Schultz was right to bite the bullet. Quite simply, the growth curve of Starbucks in the US had become unsustainable. Remarkably, even when the economy was showing visible signs of sluggishness, the chain was still opening outlets at a rate of three a day. Starbucks, it seemed, had lost sight of reality and something was going to have to give. In fact, the closure of 600 stores still might not be enough to ease the strain of the growth bubble, particularly if the US economic crisis deepens. Additional closures are also on the cards for Western Europe if the credit crunch contagion spreads into the medium term. </p>
<h3>The opportunity</h3>
<p>Market corrections tend to throw up opportunities. In this case, the upside of store closures in the US will be felt mostly in the world's emerging markets. Specifically, going forward it is almost certain that the expansion drive of Starbucks will focus on Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The coffee industry in those regions needs, therefore, to position itself for an upbeat growth trajectory over the next five years. With the singular exception of the Middle East, where Western-style coffee houses have under-performed, Starbucks has proved itself to be a key driver of coffee sales wherever it sets up shop, with the brand's concept filtering positively into the off-trade channel. In Latin America, for example, the chain's share of the coffee house market grew from 0.3% in value in 2002 to 18.1% in 2007, according to Euromonitor International, and the impact on retail sales of fresh coffee was significant, with regional volume growing 16% over the corresponding period. At present, the Starbucks brand has made limited headway in Eastern Europe, but a similar type of growth curve to Latin America is a realistic target to 2012. </p>

<h3>The risk</h3>
<p>The coffee industry in the emerging markets should work on the premise of a positive impact from Starbucks' expansion over the next five years, but it will be very important that Starbucks itself learns from errors of judgement in its home market. India, for example, has potential to become an explosive growth engine over the short to medium term (See Euromonitor comment, Rising Coffee Consumption in India) but there is a danger that Starbucks could race to saturation in key urban areas, especially if growth- hungry franchise holders are not kept in check. In fact, the downside of over-penetration would be more serious in the emerging markets than in the developed world because the current growth in on-trade coffee culture from Mumbai to Moscow to Mexico City is being driven by a new middle-class generation that is highly aspirational. If Starbucks becomes too ubiquitous, it will lose the core of its appeal and, as a consequence, trendsetting cappuccino consumers will head elsewhere. Crucially, if things turn sour for Starbucks, the fresh coffee market as a whole will suffer. There is, therefore, a great deal riding on how Starbucks sets out its international stall over the upcoming period. </p>

Emmi Group’s expansion in RTD coffee,"To many European consumers Emmi Group's Caffé Latte is the key player in the chilled RTD coffee category. However, can the Swiss player tempt American consumers?","<p>To many European consumers Emmi Group's Caffé Latte is the key player in the chilled RTD coffee category. However, can the Swiss player tempt American consumers?</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The Swiss-based Emmi Group is a rising star in the global RTD coffee category despite the growing competition from PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company. Essentially, Emmi's success has been underpinned by its aggressive geographic expansion and the innovative concept of the product and packaging, particularly in Western Europe where it now comfortably sits in top spot in this high-growth category and this is especially impressive considering the product has only been available for four years. .</p>
<p>In 2007 Emmi launched Caffé Latte in the US. The US has a relatively more established RTD coffee market than Europe, and so it remains to be seen if Emmi can replicate its European success in the US. </p>
<h2>Novelty </h2>
<p>Industry experts have pointed out that the distinctive brand image and premium innovation are the main contributory factors behind Emmi's strong performance. Its flagship brand Caffé Latte is marketed as an indulgence, lifestyle and convenience drink which targets youthful on-the-go consumers. The parent company's expertise and skill sets in fresh dairy production have helped to gain consumer trust in the quality of the product, which has in turn allowed Emmi to charge a premium. As an impulse drink designed for immediate consumption, Caffé Latte is mainly sold through petrol stations and convenience stores. This distribution and marketing approach has helped the brand avoid direct competition with relatively longer established brands such as Nescafé, Mr Brown or Jacobs.</p>
<p>Emmi Group was one of the pioneers in chilled RTD coffee packaging. The company capitalised on the on-the-go coffee consumption trend by introducing a plastic chilled version. However, Emmi's success is due to the fact that it was, in the majority of cases, the inaugural brand in the niche RTD coffee category in many countries, such as Belgium and Ireland. Therefore, its dominant position in Switzerland, Demark, Ireland and Portugal indeed reflects its first mover advantage. In Germany, currently the most valuable market for Caffé Latte, industry sources branded the product as a “groundbreaking innovation”. The brand is now available in a total of 17 European countries and there are no signs of this expansion slowing. </p>
<p>Globally, the brand generated US$130 million in retail sales in 2007. Of all the international RTD coffee brands, Caffé Latte witnessed the highest growth rates in both retail volume (CAGR 67%) and value terms (CAGR 66%) over 2004-2007, outperforming Starbucks' Frappuccino, The Coca-Cola Company's Georgia and Nestlé's Nescafe, although it is unlikely to be a threat to these brands' global sales over the short term. </p>
<h2>Hurdles </h2>
<p>Despite the above achievement, Emmi has hinted that the income from its RTD coffee arm is below expectations, partially due to an overly optimistic forecast for Caffé Latte. Although the cool summer in some markets is partly to blame, it remains a tough challenge to convince hardcore European coffee lovers to sample chilled coffee alternatives. So far Emmi has no visible market share in either Finland or Norway, which boast the highest coffee per capita consumption rates globally.</p>
<p>The competition in RTD coffee has increased over 2007-2008 as companies continue to focus on this high-growth and high-value category, attracted by the prospects of double-digit growth in the short to medium term. A noticeable number of new entrants have ventured into the Western European market. Specifically, Sara Lee Corp/Campina BV Zuivelcoöperatie has introduced Café Fresco in several countries. Emmi's market share in Belgium was halved in 2007 from 100% in 2005 as a direct impact of Sara Lee's high-profile release. In Germany, private label is still growing and continues to post a resilient threat, inevitably limiting the potential of price increases for the Emmi Group.</p>
<p>Starbucks and PepsiCo have also extended their business agreement in terms of geographic coverage. Finally, the most challenging of all is the newly established joint venture Ilko Coffee International, in which The Coca-Cola Company and the Italian coffee specialist illycafe are jointly marketing premium RTD coffee first in 10 European markets, subsequently leading to a global rollout.</p>
<h3>US opportunity </h3>
<p>Euromonitor International predicts that retail volume sales of RTD coffee will achieve a CAGR of 7% between 2008 and 2012 in the US, equating to a net increase of around US$600 million. Unsurprisingly, the US is the priority target for Emmi and it began production of Caffé Latte in the two test regions of Chicago and Miami in October 2007. The Swiss group has a local subsidiary based in New York to oversee all distribution and marketing activities. The principal marketing message is to sell the “European coffee tradition” and “Swiss quality”, with reference to sophisticated processing skills and premium ingredients.</p>
<p>However, beyond the initial promotional activities, there has not been much work done in terms of marketing and many consumers are still unaware of the Caffé Latte brand. On the distribution front, Emmi will need to increase its distributional capacity against other leading US RTD coffee brands, such as Starbucks, Monster and Rockstar which have already established strong relationships with regional or national distributors. On a positive note, however, Caffé Latte, if distributed to its full potential, has the qualities to succeed, especially given that premium beverages such as energy drinks, functional water, organic RTD tea and RTD coffee are showing no signs of slowing down. </p>

Chains scramble for a share of booming coffee market,"Already a Rs6.5 billion (US$160 million) sector, specialist coffee shops in India are expected to approach Rs18.6 billion (US$450 million) in sales by 2012, leading all other sectors, as both foreign and domestic operators press ahead with bold expansion plans. ","<p>Already a Rs6.5 billion (US$160 million) sector, specialist coffee shops in India are expected to approach Rs18.6 billion (US$450 million) in sales by 2012, leading all other sectors, as both foreign and domestic operators press ahead with bold expansion plans. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>As in other markets, strong demand from urban professionals and students has fuelled India's coffee boom; unlike many other markets, however, global titans such as Starbucks and Costa Coffee are either absent or relatively insignificant, with local operators such as Cafe Coffee Day and Barista holding dominant positions. This is changing, however, as the soaring growth and staggering potential size of the Indian market becomes impossible to ignore. With a number of major acquisitions taking place in the last two years, already-fierce competition for the Indian coffee-drinker's rupee is likely to intensify further. </p>
<h2>Coffee consumption on the rise in a land of tea-drinkers</h2>
<p>While total coffee volume sales in India were just 12% of total tea sales in 2007, that number is growing fast, particularly through on-trade channels, where total coffee volume sales have grown by 50% over the last five years, more than twice that of tea. Much of this growth has come through specialist coffee shops, which have seen sales expand nearly six fold over the review period, from Rs1.2 billion (US$25 million) in 2002 to Rs6.5 billion (US$160 million) in 2007. </p>
<p>Much of the demand for specialist coffee shops has come from a growing professional class in cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, and Bangalore, with rising incomes and busy schedules fuelling demand for a daily caffeine boost in a modern, comfortable setting. Likewise, there is a strong familiarity with the specialist coffee shop experience among the growing cohort of US- and UK-educated Indian professionals, who increasingly demand the same products and brands at home that they first encountered abroad. </p>
<p>Echoing a trend seen worldwide, specialist coffee shops have also become a highly popular gathering place for urban teenagers and college students, functioning as a comfortable “third place” between home, school, and work. The sector is one of the key beneficiaries of growing exposure to global brands and lifestyles among Indian young people, with coffee shops offering a trendy, modern, yet relatively affordable place to meet with friends, surf the Internet, or study. </p>
<h3>Local players lead a fast-evolving market</h3>
<p>Foreign operators have so far proven unable to crack the Indian market, with local chains Café Coffee Day and Barista combining for 85% of outlets and 80% of value sales in 2007, with the closest foreign competitor, Whitbread plc's Costa Coffee, accounting for less than 4% of sales and just 2% of outlets. This is partly the result of India's relatively restrictive rules regarding foreign investment—Starbucks' entry into the Indian market, for instance, has encountered numerous delays due to disputes over ownership and the potential structure of its franchised operations. </p>
<p>That said, Indian chains have proven formidable competitors in their own right—Café Coffee Day, for instance, is the retail arm of Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Ltd, a major coffee grower and exporter, which has used the Café Coffee Day brand as a high-margin complement to its commodity coffee operations. Started as an internet café in Bangalore in 1996, the chain has grown to more than 1100 outlets, including its signature Café Coffee Day shops and more than 600 Coffee Day Xpress kiosks. The company has leveraged its substantial resources in distribution and sourcing to support aggressive expansion plans—in a recent interview, the company's chairman announced a goal of 950 Café Coffee Day outlets by mid-2009. </p>
<p>In addition, the sector is already beginning to see signs of segmentation—while Café Coffee Day has pioneered kiosks as a way of reaching on-the-go consumers, main rival Barista Coffee has introduced the super-premium Barista Crème format, which combines a high-end lounge format with single-estate coffees and organic teas, with an eye on affluent “coffee connoisseurs” seeking the best experience available. Likewise, both chains have aggressively pursued brand extensions, marketing beverages, cookies, ice creams and other items under their respective brand names. </p>
<h4>Serious competition ahead</h4>
<p>The dominance of home-grown chains is already starting to shift—in March 2007, number two player Barista Coffee was purchased by Italian coffee giant Lavazza for an estimated US$125 million. Likewise, global chains such as Costa Coffee, Gloria Jean's, and Illy have all announced plans to expand their footprint in India, while Starbucks is not expected to remain on the sidelines for long—the chain has already trademarked its brand in ten Indian languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Gujarati, Bangla, and Urdu, indicating a possible market entry within the next few years, if not sooner. McDonald's McCafe could also be a factor in the mid-term, though the format in some ways conflicts with the chain's positioning in India, which remains very child- and family-focussed. </p>
<p>What all of these chains are chasing, of course, is growth, with value sales through specialist coffee shops in India expected to nearly triple by 2012. In addition to rising disposable incomes, the number of young consumers in India is simply stunning, with nearly 500 million under the age of 20, a group poised to become serious consumers over the next five years. One caveat to these rosy projections, of course, is the possibility of saturation—while the sector is growing fast, the entry of so many well-funded foreign competitors is expected to ignite fierce competition for prime locations, which could severely hamper profitability. Likewise, the primary market for specialist coffee shops remains a relatively small group of affluent consumers, with expensive coffee drinks still out of reach for vast swathes of India's population. </p>
<p>Finally, the importance of first-mover status cannot be overstated—much of Starbucks' phenomenal success in the US, for instance, came at a time when competition in specialist coffee shops was virtually nonexistent in many areas. As stated, this is not at all the case in India—any chain looking to gain a foothold there will have to come to terms with two nimble, well-funded competitors, while attempting to achieve brand recognition in what is fast becoming a very crowded field. </p>

"Loumidis Frio, innovation in the traditional Greek coffee market","Traditional Greek coffee is under threat from espresso, which young people in particular are drinking in greater quantities. Nestlé is fighting back with the launch in October 2008 of an extension of its much-loved Papagalos Loumidis brand, aimed at a younger demographic. ","<p>Traditional Greek coffee is under threat from espresso, which young people in particular are drinking in greater quantities. Nestlé is fighting back with the launch in October 2008 of an extension of its much-loved Papagalos Loumidis brand, aimed at a younger demographic. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Iced Greek coffee</h3>
<p>Loumidis Frio is not a variation of the traditional Greek fresh ground coffee brand Papagalos Loumidis rather it is a novelty is based on the preparation process. The coffee is filtered through a typical espresso machine; however it is then blended with ice and can be served with frothy milk on top. The product is trying to fight back against declining market share and the upsurge of espresso coffee.</p>
<p>Loumidis is one of Nestlé's two key brands in the Greek coffee market - Nescafé in instant coffee and Loumidis in fresh ground coffee. It is a much-loved brand that has been drunk for generations and therefore traditionally market share in Greece has been guaranteed for Nestlé. However, in order to safeguard its younger consumer base from newer coffee variants, such as espresso, Nestlé has launched this new type of iced coffee though on-trade. </p>
<h3>Focusing on youth</h3>
<p>Loumidis is a brand that the Greeks have grown up with. It is a coffee drunk by both grandparents and parents alike. The challenge faced by Nestlé is to retain the benefits of being a nostalgic brand without losing the lucrative younger consumers who are often eager for new tastes and therefore more faddish in nature. The advertising campaign for Loumidis illustrates this idea. The long-running series of advertisements feature the same actor playing an old man who serves coffee in his café. The old-fashioned cafés have been replaced by a modern café with students drinking coffee, but the well-known face of the grandfather remains the same.  Therefore linking traditional coffee with modern day coffee culture. </p>
<p>As part of its strategy to attract younger consumers, Nestlé had already launched Loumidis koupatos coffee which was designed to be consumed in 250ml servings, instead of the 50ml cup that is traditionally used for Greek coffee. This acknowledges the fact that the younger generation tends to prefer to sip and chat over a longer drink rather than gulp down a coffee shot.</p>
<h3>Utilising the on-trade channel</h3>
<p>Currently, Loumidis Frio is available through selected cafés in Athens and Thessaloniki, but it is expected to also penetrate the off-trade coffee drinking culture towards the end of spring 2009. Nestlé aims to start a campaign in Media to introduce the new concept to the consumers, and chose spring, as this is the time of the year that consumers begin to switch to iced coffee. Nestlé has been experimenting for five years with the taste of the new product. The task was not an easy one because consumers' taste buds are acclimatised to the distinct taste of Loumidis coffee and R&D had to ensure that the product tastes different, but not too different to move significantly away from the brand heritage. Therefore, Nestlé opted for a safe strategy that has historically proven successful in Greece -  familiarising the consumer through the on-trade channel. Extensive training was provided to a number of baristas in the country, a move that has also been used by Illy and Lavazza when they were still newcomers in the Greek market.</p>
<h3>The potential</h3>
<p>In 2008, Nestlé's volume share of fresh ground coffee fell to 30% from 35% in 2007 as a result of the successful penetration of espresso. However, if the launch of Loumidis Frio proves successful, the company's share is expected to bounce back. Iced coffee is enjoying considerable success in Greece where it is drunk virtually all year round. Capitalising on the popularity of the ubiquitous Frappe, the 'trendy' Freddo and Starbucks' frappuccinos, and combining this with the popular taste of Loumidis, Loumidis Frio has great potential to become a new trend throughout the country. With 3.2% CAGR over the forecast period, the otherwise mature market of fresh ground coffee is expected to reach 22,700 tonnes by 2013. In addition, Nestlé is globally the second largest player in RTD coffee with its Nescafé brand with nearly 10% of global off-trade volumes in 2007. If Loumidis Frio is a success in Greece it is conceivable that the launch of a packaged RTD coffee product could be introduced, the success of which could prompt the company to add the product to its international RTD coffee portfolio. </p>

<h3>Beyond the Greek market</h3>
<p>Greek coffee is a dominant coffee type not only in the Greek market but also in Turkey and the Middle East. Given the key position of Nestlé within these rapidly developing markets, Loumidis Frio might turn into a more international concept and expand beyond Greece over the short to medium term. The hot climates of those markets make them a welcoming environment for such a product. However, the iced coffee culture is not as strong in these countries as it is in Greece, so it will take longer for such an innovation to gain acceptance.</p>

<p>Representing over 20,000 coffee growers, Juan Valdez Café is the retail face of the National Federation of Colombian Coffee Growers, with the chain's 100+ outlets in Colombia and 17 overseas locations (including shops in New York and Madrid) serving as a potent branding tool for Colombian coffee. Powered by the iconic Juan Valdez brand name, the cafes are the next step in the evolution of the global coffee trade, as more growers and roasters chase the high profits and marketing/branding potential offered by a chained coffee shop format. </p>
<h2>The face of Colombian coffee, on land and in the air</h2>
<p>While the fictional Juan Valdez has served as the official logo of Colombian coffee growers since 1959, efforts to promote the brand have accelerated in recent years—in addition to the rapid expansion of the Juan Valdez Café concepts, Juan Valdez now appears on planes operated by Avianca, the Colombian national airline, while Colombian coffee is served on all flights. Much of the impetus for these efforts has come from the growing global popularity of specialist coffee shops in particular and café culture in general—in Colombia, for example, cafes/bars have averaged more than 10% annual sales growth over the last five years, with sales surpassing Col$1 bn (US$500 million) in 2007, while growth in specialist coffee shops has been even stronger, led by Juan Valdez Café's expansion from just one outlet in 2002 to more than 100 in 2008. </p>
<p>As in other markets, an improving economy and steady disposable income growth has played a role in the expansion of cafes and specialist coffee shops in Colombia, as relatively affluent urban residents and students look for a high-quality, comfortable place to relax or socialize. In Colombia, however, this trend has been intensified by efforts to promote the country's most famous export, starting at home—despite the country's status as the world's third-largest coffee producer, consumption in Colombia remains relatively low, though this is changing as operators like Juan Valdez and Oma look to start a coffee boom among Colombian consumers. </p>
<h3>Branded operations point the way</h3>
<p>The success of Juan Valdez Café likely portends further vertical integration in the global coffee trade, as more coffee growers, roasters, and distributors attempt to capture a larger slice of the value chain. While Colombian coffee and the Juan Valdez name already enjoy a degree of global recognition, this process is already underway in other, less-known coffee-producing areas like Vietnam, where local producer Trung Nguyen, already dominant in Vietnam specialist coffee shops, has begun outlet expansion into East Asia, while its branded retail coffee beans can be found in a number of global markets. </p>
<p>To be sure, many of these efforts could fall flat—the global market for foodservice coffee grows more competitive by the day, with global giants like Starbucks and McDonald's joined by increasingly important regional chains, plus a huge and growing cohort of small independent operators. And establishing an effective brand is no easy task—Juan Valdez Café remains a minor operator on the global stage, despite a brand name that is nearly fifty years old. Establishing similar recognition for the coffees of Kenya, Jamaica, Ethiopia, and so on could prove a tall order. That said, the potential profits involved are significant, while at the high end demand continues to grow for premium, “single-origin” coffees, with many consumers likely to gravitate towards operators able to claim a real connection with the regions where their coffees originate. </p>

<h3>Forecast potential for RTD tea globally</h3>
<p>The global market for RTD tea is one of the more niche soft drinks categories. However, it is sized at over 22 billion litres and just over US$32 billion in 2007. The recent upsurge in interest in the category is driven by the perceived untapped potential volume and value of the market. Coupled with key FMCG players focusing there business interests away from the slow moving sugarised soft drinks categories, for example carbonates. With favourable 2006-07 growth rates of 10% in volume and 11% in value terms, Euromonitor International estimates that the market size in 2012 will be almost 30 billion litres and US$42 billion.</p>
<p>Currently the RTD tea market is heavily concentrated among four markets of China, Japan, USA and Indonesia, which account for 75% of global unit volumes. Japan is by far largest market in value terms and is also the most mature market with Euromonitor International forecasting only 1.9% volume growth in 2007. As such manufacturers are eyeing up new markets in order to ensure continued growth over the forecast period.</p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenotes"">Bubble indicates size of the soft drinks market in total volume terms in 2007</p>
<h3>Developed markets offer the best value returns in the short term</h3>
<p>The biggest growth market in terms of value is the US where all of the major players are circling. In this market RTD tea grew by twice the rate of soft drinks as a whole in 2007 driven by the increased concern over health and wellness and a relative consumer malaise surrounding carbonates, especially cola-fatigue among higher-income consumers. The market has seen Suntory team up with Nestle to distribute its Japanese green tea brand Iyemon Cha in 2008 through Nestlé Waters and The Coca-Cola Company made a 40% acquisition of Honest Tea in 2007, with intent to secure a controlling stake by 2010. In this market the rise of premium products, especially those which appeal to health-conscious consumers represents a genuine opportunity. High-profile launches include BPW's Enviga and Ferolito Vultaggio & Sons' Arizona Green Tea Energy. In this market the key to future growth will be the continued introduction of explicitly functional RTD tea products and ultra premium brands. Manufacturers are introducing green tea beverages fortified with electrolytes and vitamins. Other all natural options with added energy boosters such as Ginseng and Guarana will also perform well.</p>
<h3>Middle income countries need to be approached with sensitivity</h3>
<p>There are also huge opportunities within middle income regions such as Russia and Latin America. Rising incomes among the richer sections of society and the importing of health trends from high-income countries is driving the growth of the sector from extremely low per capita levels. Russian RTD grew by a staggering 52% volume in 2007 and Latin American markets such as Brazil, which grew by 7% CAGR between 2000-2007, also performed strongly. Manufacturers have huge opportunities in these markets but there are also large risks.</p>
<p>The key in these markets is for multinationals to understand the local perceptions of tea products and flavour preferences. For example, in Russia per capita hot tea consumption is very high with a range of successful flavoured brews available throughout the country. Here consumers will be relatively receptive to the product whereas in some countries such as Mexico tea is seen as a product used solely for upset stomachs and so the launch of RTD tea has been met with some confusion. Price positioning will also be crucial. Manufacturers must ensure that the unit price is accessible to middle-income consumers, especially the young, who are the primary drinkers of these products but must avoid launching value options as this will devalue the premium image of the product and temper the value gains as volumes increase. This premium positioning is one of its best selling points of the product.</p>

<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Top 10 RTD Coffee markets -  2007-2012</h4>
<p>Country<img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\3bfeebbb-2b0f-421a-af76-255d20736ad1.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h3>RTD Coffee has extremely low global penetration but huge potential</h3>
<p>RTD Coffee is the smallest global soft drinks category with volumes only a seventh compared to RTD tea. The extent of these low volumes is compounded by the fact that almost 70% of global volumes and values are in Japan.</p>
<p>Despite the extremely low per capita consumption outside of Japan, RTD coffee has been targeted by a number of large global soft drinks players as a key area for growth over the medium to long term. Euromonitor forecasts huge growth driven by the premiumisation of the soft drinks market globally and the demand for a quick energy fix from on-the-go consumers. In 2008, The Coca-Cola Company and Italy's Illycaffè Spa entered into a joint venture to role out the product in European markets, Emmi has targeted the US market for expansion and Suntory and Ajinomoto have strongly increased their investment in South East Asia. With consumption so low, even non-existent in some markets such as Ukraine, these investments could be seen as a risk. </p>
<p>Perhaps the key determinant of success will be how RTD coffee relates to on-trade hot coffee consumption. In Western Europe, the high per capita consumption of hot coffee through foodservice outlets has always been seen as a barrier to the success of RTD coffee, which is often expensive, as consumers favour the higher quality offered by fresh produce. However, in Eastern Europe where on-trade coffee consumption is low but growing fast it is thought that RTD coffee can jump on the bandwagon of growing premium coffee consumption and offer middle class consumers a fast and convenient means of sating their coffee fix. As with RTD tea positioning will also be crucial to success. In Japan RTD coffee has very strong penetration in vending machines in train stations, offices and public buildings. In the developed hot coffee markets of Western Europe and North America it is these channels, which offer the greatest potential for growth. Pricing will also be key as although the manufacturer interest in the sector is in part stimulated by the high unit price of the product producers must be careful not to price their target middle-income, urban and youthful consumers out of the market, especially as they initially attempt to increase market penetration.  </p>
<p>The RTD's markets share similarities. Recognising the differences will ensure success</p>
<p>Clearly there are some key similarities between the RTD tea and RTD coffee markets. They are both relatively concentrated and offer manufacturers huge growth potential, which has driven frenzied activity from the major players. However, it would be a mistake to think of the two markets as flip sides of the same coin. They are different products, whose growth is being driven by markedly different factors and manufacturers must ensure that they acknowledge these differences between the sectors and also approach each country with sensitivity to local needs and concerns and position the products appropriately. Only then will the untapped potential of these products be fully realised.</p>

Can Starbucks do for tea what it has done for fresh coffee?,Significant development of leaf tea consumption culture might come from an unlikely source in 2009 - the iconic coffee house brand Starbucks. Euromonitor International investigates. ,"<p>Significant development of leaf tea consumption culture might come from an unlikely source in 2009 - the iconic coffee house brand Starbucks. Euromonitor International investigates. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>2008 was a difficult year for Starbucks, especially in its home US market where the chain's phenomenal growth bubble finally burst, leading to the closure of hundreds of underperforming outlets (See Euromonitor Comment, Starbucks wakes up and smells the coffee, July 2008). Over the past quarter century Starbucks has emerged as a ubiquitous American brand and a global leader in the development of out-of-home coffee culture. Recession in the US and Western Europe has undeniably tripped up the company's triumphant run of growth, but it is one of a handful of powerful global brands that has the potential to emerge even stronger once the world's big economies get back on their feet.</p>
<h3>Hot tea to calm the storm</h3>
<p>Tough times call for tough decisions, hence the recognition last year by CEO Howard Schultz that the Starbucks growth curve had become unsustainable. On the back of that decision, the company's first strategic move of 2009 was always going to be important, but few expected the promotion of a new range of hot tea choices, spearheaded by the Tazo range, to be at the forefront of the company's new year product development. In fact, hot tea already accounts for around one in 10 of the beverages consumed in Starbucks stores, according to company sources, but the latest offerings, which came on stream in January 2009 in the US, aim to raise that level of participation, begging the question: can Starbucks do for tea what it is has done for coffee? </p>
<p>The first point to consider is that an increased focus on hot tea is a bold response to a sector crying out for innovation, especially in the developed markets. Indeed, the value of the black tea category lost further ground to fresh coffee in 2008, according to the latest available data from Euromonitor International. There is a sense, however, that the current global operating environment could become less conducive to coffee consumption over the short term. Specifically, coffee demand has tended to align favourably with money-rich-time-poor lifestyles, which have been a key feature of the boom years, but there is mounting evidence that Western professionals are becoming less tolerant of products that reflect fast and busy routines. </p>
<p>Herein lies the potential attraction of hot tea, which can be marketed along the lines of a calmer, altogether less frenzied lifestyle choice. Crucially, leaf tea also fits well into the better-for-you beverage zone, which is increasingly important in the industrialised markets. This is not to say that urban professionals are about to abandon their daily espresso hit in Starbucks, but, critically, the occasions for leaf tea consumption are likely to broaden as consumers seek out new, stress-free moments during their working day. This is, logically, the type of consumption occasion that Starbucks is betting on with its new leaf tea investment. </p>

<h3>Taking the stress out of marketing</h3>
<p>Consumer weariness in the developed markets, where optimism is running at its lowest ebb in years, will become an increasingly key feature of marketing across all beverage categories this year. Soft drinks leader Coca-Cola, for example, is set to replace its slogan 'The Coke Side of Life' with “Open Happiness', its first new global advertising campaign for three years. This is a deliberate move to tap into consumers' desire for optimism at a time of bleak macro-economic conditions. The introduction by Starbucks of its tea-break concept is tapping into the same type of aspiration. Specifically, it is aspiration geared to a healthier and less stressful pace of life. In fact, if the current period of economic crisis in the industrialised markets turns from a recession into a slump, we could see a fundamental correction in marketing activity whereby the notion of aspiration as something aligned with affluence, fashion and fast-living is dissolved, except, perhaps, in the emerging markets. </p>
<p>Starbucks will almost certainly push the health attributes of its new hot tea portfolio in the US, especially the anti-ageing antioxidants and low calories. This spells potentially very good news for the hot tea sector as a whole because higher-profile exposure in the world's leading café chain will almost certainly spill positively into stronger performances of leaf tea brands at a retail level. Gourmet coffee got just such a boost when Starbucks first came into the market. And at a time of recession, a revamping of the functionality of leaf tea could result in higher value returns than the industry has been anticipating. It is also important to point out that although hot tea has been available at Starbucks for some time, the new Tazo range is the first to offer full-leaf tea bags, which will allow consumers to steep their tea to their own taste. Crucially, this type of hot tea tailoring fits extremely well within the Starbucks concept.</p>
<p>Choices such as Black Tea Latte and caffeine-free tea infusions as well as adventurous new flavour formats, including options steamed with fruit juices, are precisely the type of creative innovations that the hot tea sector has been looking for as a vehicle to attract a new generation of consumers. It is ironic, perhaps, that a global on-trade coffee heavyweight should become a major potential flag-bearer for leaf tea, but much will also depend on whether the mainstream hot tea manufacturers are able to take the ball and run with it in the retail sector. </p>
<p>The London Fog Latte (a blend of black tea, citrus bergamot, lavender, vanilla and steamed milk) might not displace the Caffe Latte in popularity over the short term in Starbucks stores, but it is the type of novelty that could give leaf tea a major out-of-home boost and develop into something altogether more culturally entrenched going forward. The leaf tea industry needs to leverage this type of forward-thinking innovation. It is a potential silver lining to an otherwise stormy forecast operating environment. </p>

Mexico’s Italian Coffee Company prospers under the radar,"While Starbucks Corp remains the runaway sales leader, local chain The Italian Coffee Company leads all specialist coffee shops in Mexico in outlet terms, with an expansion strategy focused on low prices and a vast consumer base outside of Mexico City. ","<p>While Starbucks Corp remains the runaway sales leader, local chain The Italian Coffee Company leads all specialist coffee shops in Mexico in outlet terms, with an expansion strategy focused on low prices and a vast consumer base outside of Mexico City. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The chain's success illustrates both the considerable potential of Mexico's foodservice coffee market, which remains relatively underdeveloped despite brisk expansion in recent years, as well as the many paths to growth available in emerging markets. While capitals and major cities such as Mexico City tend to be the first, last, and often only focus for many chains, there is often great potential in more secondary urban areas, where a vast cohort of consumers continue to see their disposable incomes rise, a trend likely to persist over the long term even as projections for the next two years grow increasingly dire. </p>
<h2>Starbucks, Italian Coffee Company plot different paths to growth</h2>
<p>As noted, Starbucks is Mexico's leading specialist coffee shop chain by sales, posting Mx$870 million (US$80 million) in sales in 2007, more than twice that of Italian Coffee Company with Mx$351 million (US$32 million), according to Euromonitor data. The picture is far different in terms of outlets, however, with Italian Coffee Company holding the lead with 342 outlets at the close of 2007 to Starbucks' 194. The vast disparity in per-store sales highlights an important part of Italian Coffee Company's business model, with the chain firmly positioned as a lower-cost alternative to Starbucks, yet still offering quality superior to that of many smaller independents. </p>
<p>Also part of this strategy is a focus on urban areas outside of Mexico City—according to company reports, Italian Coffee Company has just 24 outlets in both the Federal District and the state of Mexico which encompass much of the Mexico City metro area, compared to more than 100 for Starbucks. By contrast, Italian Coffee Company's position is far stronger in more secondary urban centres—while Starbucks is still the leader in the wealthy city of Monterrey, with 29 outlets to Italian Coffee Company's 18, it lags far behind in southern states like Oaxaca and Chiapas, where it has no presence, while Italian Coffee Company operates 19 and 10 stores, respectively, a disparity found in numerous other Mexican states, as well. While Starbucks and partner Alsea have pursued a strategy of maximum density in Mexico City, home to the country's largest concentration of relatively wealthy, cosmopolitan consumers, Italian Coffee Company has moved quickly to build a nationwide brand, with the chain's relatively low-cost model allowing it to build profitable stores in nearly every state in Mexico. </p>
<h3>Coffee primed for growth in the mid to long-term</h3>
<p>Despite radically different approaches, both Starbucks and Italian Coffee Company have enjoyed fairly spectacular growth over the review period—Starbucks has grown sales more than tenfold since 2003, while Italian Coffee Company has added more than 200 locations over the last four years. Both chains have benefited from the rapid development of café culture in Mexico, with sales through specialist coffee shops more than tripling since 2002, surpassing Mx$2.3 billion (US$220 million) in 2007. Overall coffee consumption has expanded, averaging nearly 5% annual volume growth since 2003, according to Euromonitor. Reflecting the steady growth of a cafes and a growing awareness of better-quality coffee, fresh coffee has been the growth leader over the review period, with total fresh coffee consumption up more than 50% since 2003 as instant coffee consumption has stagnated. </p>
<p>While the current global economic crisis is likely to impact demand severely in the short-term (Alsea, Starbucks' joint-venture partner in Mexico, has already scaled back its expansion plans for 2009, citing slower traffic and rising costs), overall coffee consumption is expected to continue on its long-term upward trajectory, surpassing 50,000 tonnes annually by 2012 on the strength of average annual growth exceeding 4%. Echoing a trend seen in other coffee-growing nations, awareness of domestically-grown coffee continues to grow among Mexican consumers, likely encouraging more local coffee growers to expand their branded operations in an effort to drive value-added sales. </p>
<h4>Success reveals maturing market</h4>
<p>The rapid growth of Italian Coffee Company, with its low-cost, low-priced strategy, reveals a Mexican market for foodservice coffee which has become increasingly multi-tiered—while more premium operators like Starbucks and Café Punto del Cielo have enjoyed brisk growth by targeting relatively well-off consumers with a more upscale experience, there is a significant (and growing) market for good-quality coffee at an affordable price. The ranks of budget-conscious consumers seeking the occasional luxury are likely to swell further as Mexico feels the effects of the global economic slowdown, with even wealthier consumers likely to give low-priced Italian Coffee Company a second look, particularly in urban areas where the number of alternative coffee shops is limited. </p>
<p>More broadly, the example of Italian Coffee Company is an object lesson in looking beyond capital cities and financial centres when setting up shop in emerging markets—while such urban areas do tend to contain the largest concentration of upper-income consumers, competition is fierce and rents are often sky-high. Major markets like Russia, Mexico, and Turkey are all home to a large number of secondary urban centres where disposable incomes are on the rise and demand for new brands is growing. Rents in these areas tend to be lower, while prime real estate is far more readily available. What's more, the potential for first-mover advantages is strong for those operators able to enter a market early—in the case of Italian Coffee Company, a heavy presence outside of Mexico City could pay dividends in the long-term, potentially allowing a greater presence in the capital as awareness of the brand grows nationwide. </p>

Coffee provides a boost for alcoholic drinks,"Coffee flavours and caffeine additives emerged as one of the key trends driving innovation in 2008. Taking into account consumption habits favouring either the taste or the energising attributes of coffee, several manufacturers introduced a number of new, industry-bridging products in segments ranging from spirits and RTDs to beer. ","<p>Coffee flavours and caffeine additives emerged as one of the key trends driving innovation in 2008. Taking into account consumption habits favouring either the taste or the energising attributes of coffee, several manufacturers introduced a number of new, industry-bridging products in segments ranging from spirits and RTDs to beer. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>The flavour factor </h3>
<p>The Berentzen Milch-Kaffee cream-based liqueur from Berentzen-Gruppe AG in Germany was launched in April 2008 to tap into the country's widespread coffee drinking culture. This new cream-based liqueur is milk coffee flavoured, while natural ingredients are used in its production. With per capita coffee consumption in Germany standing at 96 litres, targeting this audience offers significant potential.</p>
<p>Efes Dark Brown beer was also introduced in April 2008 by Anadolu Efes AS in Turkey. Turkey has a long coffee drinking tradition, while beer sales in the country are witnessing dynamic growth, with the category posting a volume CAGR of 12% over 2003-2008. Efes Dark Brown combines the two tastes together, and its high alcohol content may make it a substitute for other alcoholic drinks, such as spirits. A projected volume CAGR of 8.5% for coffee over 2008-2013 should mean good prospects for the product over the forecast period.</p>
<p>Guatemala offers another interesting example. Cafetto from Industrias Licoreras de Guatemala combines the flavours of coffee and rum in a digestive liqueur, making it the sort of product that would appeal to trendy affluent consumers. Coffee is the preferred hot drink in Guatemala. Even though it is a mature category, it is still projected to achieve a healthy volume CAGR of 4% over 2008-2013.  </p>
<h3>The energising effect</h3>
<p>With per capita coffee consumption of 75 litres, Greece enjoys an established coffee culture. While RTDs have largely proven to be a short-lived fad in the country, with sales plummeting, the launch of Segredo from Athenian Brewery SA might well prove to be an exception. This is the first RTD in the Greek market with coffee extracts, and manufacturer Athenian Brewery has entered into an agreement with Vivartia SA to distribute the product via Flocafé, the most popular specialist coffee shop chain in Greece, with 306 outlets throughout the country in 2007.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Wide Eye is the latest launch from Constellation Brands in the US, and aims to tap into consumer need for an energy-boosting alcoholic variant. Wide Eye comes with caffeine additives, about 55mg in a 44g shot, which is equivalent to half a standard espresso. With energy drinks consumption amounting to 4.4 litres per capita, there is huge potential for such products provided manufacturers can appease health concerns and allegations of focusing on underage drinkers.</p>
<h3>Pitfalls and opportunities </h3>
<p>Looking ahead, Euromonitor International believes that there is potential in industry-bridging ventures as well as in incorporating country-specific consumption traits into new product developments. The introduction of flavoured variants gave a significant boost to the vodka segment over the review period, while flavoured beer and RTDs successfully managed to tap into younger and female audiences.</p>
<p> On the other hand, Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing were forced on to the defensive in early 2008 when their products - A-B's Tilt and Miller's Sparks line - came under severe scrutiny for allegedly being deceptively labelled or targeting minors. In this context, energy-boosting alcoholic beverages are bound to be met with scepticism while information and educational campaigns will be essential to minimise a potential backlash.</p>

Coffee Republic’s demise signals retrenchment in UK specialist coffee shops,"UK-based coffee shop chain Coffee Republic filed for bankruptcy this week, with company officials citing depressed consumer spending as the main factor behind the chain's continued losses. ","<p>UK-based coffee shop chain Coffee Republic filed for bankruptcy this week, with company officials citing depressed consumer spending as the main factor behind the chain's continued losses. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>While the dismal UK economy doubtless contributed, Coffee Republic's problems run far deeper, with the chain (one of the first UK specialist coffee shop chains to gain significant share) faring poorly over the last five years against stiff competition from rivals such as Starbucks, Costa Coffee, and Caffe Nero, among others. The recession is expected to drive further retrenchment in the previously-booming specialist coffee shop sector, as business models built upon the breakneck growth possible over the last five years become unworkable in a new consumer spending environment. While there is room for share gains even in a declining market, a projected two-year decline in UK specialist coffee shop sales is expected to bring further bankruptcies before growth resumes. </p>
<h2>First-to-market brings little profit</h2>
<p>Coffee Republic's bankruptcy filing is the final act in a long decline, with sales falling every year from 2001 to 2007. A pioneer in the UK coffee shop sector at the time of its founding in 1995, the chain wilted in the face of growing competition from Starbucks, Costa Coffee, and Caffe Nero, along with smaller operations operated by global players such as Tchibo, Nestle, BP, and SSP Group. What's more, in almost fifteen years of operation Coffee Republic has never been consistently profitable, neither during its high-growth period in the late 1990's-early 2000's nor during its more recent history, when it shuttered multiple unprofitable outlets every year. While the Coffee Republic's coffee generally received high marks from consumers, allowing it to retain a degree of brand loyalty, operations were never a strength, both in terms of controlling costs and maintaining outlets, many of which had become increasingly dingy and outdated at the time of the company's 2006 reorganisation, when a shareholder revolt ousted company founder Bobby Hashemi. </p>
<p>While Coffee Republic's new management team was not lacking for new ideas, expanding the chain's franchising program, moving into markets outside the UK, and inking concession agreements with site operators such as Greene King, Enterprise Inns, and theatre chain Cineworld, losses continued to mount, with the collapse of consumer spending seen in late 2008 making bankruptcy inevitable. Despite being one of the first entrants into the UK specialist coffee shop market, opening its doors prior to both Starbucks UK and Caffe Nero, Coffee Republic was never able to leverage this first-mover advantage into a dominant market position, nor was it able to finance expansion at a rate that would keep pace with more profitable, better-funded rivals. </p>
<h3>Major shakeout underway</h3>
<p>Though Coffee Republic is one of the first UK coffee shop chains to enter administration during the current downturn, it is likely not the last—after five years of 11% average annual sales growth, the chained specialist coffee shops sector is expected to contract by 11% by 2010, as cash-strapped consumers make fewer trips to the local coffee bar. Even Starbucks, the UK's second-largest chain, saw sales slip 8% in 2008, with the chain's heavy concentration in the London metro area leaving it vulnerable to severe cutbacks in the finance sector. </p>
<p>That said, the effects of the recession have not been equally felt; both Costa Coffee and Caffe Nero posted sales gains in 2008, growing market share in what remains a GBP1.3 billion sector, while Costa Coffee has continued to report same-store sales increases into 2009. Coffee Republic's bankruptcy likely marks an end to the boom phase of the UK specialist coffee shop sector, with further rationalization of outlets expected. No longer will chains such as Coffee Republic rack up years of losses on the strength of potential future growth; instead, share gains will likely accrue to a select number of established profitable operators, who can be expected to snap up the most attractive sites from now-defunct competitors—Coffee Republic's company-owned outlets are already on sale, and a continued shakeout in the sector will put more sites on the market, potentially leading to lower average rents. While sales are expected to contract, total chained specialist coffee shop outlets are projected to expand at a rate of five percent per year over the next five years, indicating no letup in site acquisition and outlet construction, particularly by the largest, best-funded chains. While declining sales over the next two years will put pressure on all operators, the continued success of chains such as Costa Coffee indicate a substantial degree of brand loyalty still exists, something which should go a long way in helping the best-known chains to ride out the downturn, while their ongoing expansion should leave them well-positioned when the recovery finally comes.</p>

Cold comfort as recession threatens coffee consumption in Greece,"Last year, Greece knocked back the per capita equivalent of 75 RTD litres of instant coffee.

Euromonitor International looks into the dynamics of the sector and its prospects going forward. </p>

<h2>Frappé is an instant hit</h2>
<p>Coffee culture is deeply rooted across mainland Greece and the islands and is most commonly symbolised by the age-old preparation of a strong, syrupy fresh coffee, which is much like Turkish coffee in taste and consistency. It is odd, therefore, that a country with such a strong fresh coffee heritage should have embraced so enthusiastically the instant format. Greek coffee is, quite simply, a world apart from instant granules. And for that reason, Greece is often wrongly perceived as a fresh rather than an instant market. </p>
<p>The connection to instant coffee can be explained in one word, frappé. Indeed, while Greece, unlike some of the world's more traditional coffee markets, is an importer rather than a producer of coffee beans, it does have a big claim to fame in the annals of international coffee culture. This is because it is widely credited with the invention, albeit accidentally, of the frappé, a foamy cold version of coffee that, in various guises, has become a staple of coffee house chains from New York to Moscow. As the story goes, an employee from Nestlé was unable to boil water to make a cup of instant coffee during an international trade fair in Thessaloniki in 1957. As a result, he prepared the drink cold, with ice, and so the frappé was born. </p>
<p>In the interim half century, the frappé has become an icon of consumer culture in Greece. Indeed, to this day it is a pervasive feature of both off- and on-trade coffee consumption. Roadside kiosks, for example, will typically stock frappé kits in their fridges while hand-held electric foam beaters are a ubiquitous product on supermarket shelves. It is, therefore, little surprise that an instant coffee frappé is the biggest commercial hit of the Nestlé Hellas brand portfolio and is the prime driver of the company's dominance of the instant coffee market, which in 2008 reached 77% of retail volume, according to data from Euromonitor International. </p>
<p>In the on-trade, an important driver of the frappé has traditionally been the length of time it takes to drink one. A Greek frappé is, in short, the opposite of a quick caffeine fix, although it can often contain four times the caffeine level of an Italian espresso. Its consumption longevity, with the foam replenishing as the ice melts, was a perfect match for Greek lifestyle. Or at least that was the case until recently. Specifically, over a decade of sustained economic growth in Greece has triggered a change in consumer lifestyles and there is now a burgeoning upwardly mobile, young professional class that is less inclined to laze away hours in a coffee house. As such, this new generation has a stronger propensity toward quick hit espresso culture, in line with trends across much of Western Europe. </p>
<p>What marks Greece as different is that the espresso has adapted to the frappé concept of serving cold, and in so doing it has created a freddo. The freddo is, without doubt, a threat to the frappé and this is bad news for the instant category because the freddo is typically made from fresh rather than instant coffee. The freddo signals, furthermore, a significant premiumisation of coffee consumption in Greece, especially in the urban on-trade. </p>
<p>Not to miss an opportunity, Nestlé Hellas innovated with its own new frappe-style coffee concept in the final quarter of last year, launching Loumidis Frio, which is the country's first Greek coffee to be served cold. It is currently only available in the on-trade channel, but has been supported by a high- profile television campaign. Crucially, it is a further example of the premiumisation of coffee consumption in Greece, with the brand targeting trendy, middle-income young adults. </p>
<h3>Coffee and cigarettes</h3>
<p>The on-trade has long been the showcase channel for innovation in Greece's coffee market. However, a major potential downside for Loumidis Frio as well as for the freddo and frappé concepts is the introduction of a smoking ban across the country from 2010. Indeed, if coffee consumption is pervasive in Greece, so too is smoking. In fact, per capita cigarette consumption is higher in Greece than anywhere in the world, according to data from Euromonitor International. And, in many instances, coffee and cigarettes, quite literally, go hand in hand. </p>
<p>In the winter months, a ban on smoking inside coffee houses is likely, therefore, to apply downward pressure on coffee demand, at least in the first year of the ban. Indeed, it might well impact most negatively on the drawn out consumption of the frappé as smokers will spend increasingly less time in coffee houses. There will, of course, be a much lower impact during the summer because on-trade activity is typically outside. </p>
<p>A bigger concern for the coffee market in Greece relates, however, to the worsening macro-economic climate. In short, the global financial crisis has wounded the Greek economy and is set to end 15 back-to-back years of GDP growth. The Central Bank, as well as the IMF, is forecasting a contraction of between 1-2% this year. For example, international tourism, an important economic driver, is falling off sharply as cash-strapped holidaymakers from the UK and EuroZone elect to stay at home. The construction industry, an important indicator of economic strength, is also in crisis. Critically, the country is unable to implement the type of fiscal stimulus packages seen in neighbouring Turkey, because the budget deficit and public debt are simply too high. </p>
<p>The negative implications for the coffee sector could run deep because it is the country's newfound wealth of the past decade that has been the engine of premiumisation. As disposable income weakens so too will confidence, and so too will on-trade coffee consumption. Paradoxically, old-school Greek coffee as well as low-price off-trade instant frappé might get a small bounce as the new middle-class trades back down to more traditional and less expensive coffee options. </p>
<p>A potentially protracted recession will certainly be a challenging time for the sector. Yet, given the track record in Greece for coffee innovation, it might even trigger another new coffee concept, geared around economy of price. Indeed, the international coffee industry would be wise to take a closer look at how coffee demand has evolved in Greece in recent decades because there are important lessons in opportunism and innovation. And one thing is for sure, if there is a new concept on the Greek horizon, it will be a coffee served cold.</p>

Algeria: A Nation of Coffee Drinkers with Opportunity for Multi-National Companies,Algeria is a nation of coffee drinkers with the highest consumption in Africa and 9th highest household consumption of fresh coffee in the world.  Algeria recently completed a partnership agreement with the EU and is assumed to be joining the WTO.,"<p>Algeria is a nation of coffee drinkers with the highest consumption in Africa and 9th highest household consumption of fresh coffee in the world.  Algeria recently completed a partnership agreement with the EU and is assumed to be joining the WTO.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Algerian households consume, on average, 1,700 cups of fresh coffee per year.  So people are drinking coffee at different times during the day.  Coffee consumption varies greatly across the country.  While coffee is clearly dominant in the country's north, household consumption is considerably lower in the southern and western regions, where green and black tea lead hot drinks sales.  As Algerians' willingness to pay more for quality coffee increases in line with their growing disposable income, a number of premium brands, such as Lavazza and Carte Noire, have been successfully introduced to the marketplace.</p>
<p>As a nation of coffee drinkers, where coffee is consumed at different occasions during the day, Algeria is littered with small- and medium-sized neighbourhood cafés and coffee shops, where patrons meet to drink coffee whilst playing cards or dominoes. While large coffee chains, such as Starbucks, are conspicuous by their absence, the on-trade is, nonetheless, largely saturated.  Euromonitor International estimates the total number of neighbourhood cafes throughout the country to be in the region of 20,000. The arrival of multinational chains in the future will create serious competition for such establishments, especially in more affluent urban areas.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Algeria's off-trade distribution structure has slowly evolved, with the once dominant position of small grocery retailers and convenience stores being slowly eroded by the increased presence of supermarkets. The recent arrival of Carrefour is expected to further this trend.</p>
<h2>The Changing Competitive Landscape</h2>
<p>A major impact on brand shares will be caused by Algeria's recent EU partnership agreement and its expected accession to the WTO. As a consequence, tariffs on imported coffee will increasingly be removed in the coming years. This will improve the future prospects of imported brands as they become more affordable to the greater Algerian populace.</p>
<p>In terms of volume, sales are currently dominated by domestic brands, such as Facto, Nisière, Bonal, Aoued and Benbrik. The dominance of these brands, all of which are produced by medium-sized roasting houses, is attributable to their producers' dual ability to produce coffee of a higher quality than their smaller domestic competitors, while simultaneously managing to keep their prices below those of imported brands.</p>
<p>Imported premium brands, such as Carte Noire and Maxwell House, are becoming increasingly popular with the country's better-off urban population, although their volume sales remain marginal at present. The growing importance of imported brands is expected to continue in the future, with predictions of considerably increased sector share over the next few years as import taxes are reduced.</p>
<p>Imported coffee brands remain at a distinct disadvantage to domestic brands due to the Algerian government's levying of a 30% import tax. As a result, while Algeria's small upper-class consumes mostly foreign premium brands, the majority of the population remains loyal to more affordable domestic brands.</p>
<p>While several Algerian coffee manufacturers have begun modernising their facilities, many with the aid of EU development funds, the majority have not. Euromonitor International expects that the ever increasing number of European brands seeking to establish a presence in the region will further impact the share held by these smaller producers.</p>
<h2>Opportunities for Multi-Nationals</h2>
<p>Since Algerian household coffee consumption is so high, the coffee sector is largely saturated. As a result, no substantial increase in household consumption is expected over the next several years. Consequently, brand growth is expected to come from stealing competitive share.</p>
<p>Due to the aspirational nature of premium coffee brands, they are expected to increase their share at the expense of regular fresh coffee and lower-quality brands.  Algerian consumers would be attracted to the higher quality and prestige of multinational brands if the cost barrier were removed, and this cost disparity is expected to diminish over the next few years.  Algeria's impending WTO accession and recent EU association agreement are expected to further this trend. This anticipated removal of trade barriers along with a continued Algerian economic recovery are expected to increase demand for multinational brands, whilst simultaneously leading to the decline of many smaller domestic producers.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a number of foreign companies will enter the Algerian market over the next few years, utilising their superior logistics, larger advertising budgets and established distribution networks to succeed at the expense of smaller domestic operators.  The new foreign competition would succeed at the expense of local brands.  To be most successful the large multi-nationals will also need to adapt their brand strategies to Algeria's local coffee drinking culture.   Strategies tailored towards households with multiple coffee drinkers, a focus on the northern region where coffee is consumed more frequently, and targeting male coffee drinkers in cafés would all be possible approaches.</p>

Kraft could sell coffee to part finance Cadbury deal,"If Kraft Foods' audacious, albeit unsolicited, US$16.5 billion bid for Cadbury needs a bigger injection of cash, one possible scenario is the divestment of its coffee business, the second biggest in the world. But who would buy it? Euromonitor International investigates. ","<p>If Kraft Foods' audacious, albeit unsolicited, US$16.5 billion bid for Cadbury needs a bigger injection of cash, one possible scenario is the divestment of its coffee business, the second biggest in the world. But who would buy it? Euromonitor International investigates. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Put up or shut up</h2>
<p>In the latest instalment of an unfolding mega deal drama, Cadbury, the target of a hostile bid, has asked UK authorities to set Kraft, the suitor, a deadline for making its offer formal. It is a case of put up or shut up. So far, there has been no counter bid, but you get the feeling Nestlé might be waiting in the wings. And there could be others thinking of showing their hand too, possibly Hershey. Given the boldness of Kraft's initial approach, it seems unlikely that the company will go away quietly. A retreat, quite frankly, would leave too much corporate egg on its face. </p>
<p>But what if Kraft needs to go over and above an already toppy US$16.5 billion? The cash portion of the proposal is upwards of 40%, which is probably a tough nut to swallow for some of its shareholders. And if the numbers start rolling higher, something will surely have to give. And that could mean a sale of assets, of which the coffee business looks, on paper, to be in pole position. While coffee has been a key component of Kraft's growth strategy over the past decade, maturity in its key Western European market, loss of market share for Maxwell House in the US and related downside contagion from the financial crisis mean that the coffee business has started to look dispensable. </p>
<p>Last year, Kraft's coffee portfolio summed a global retail value of around US$7.4 billion, according to Euromonitor International. That was around 46% less than Nestlé, the category leader. Western Europe fuelled some 41% of revenue against a more modest 12% in North America. But, Kraft's coffee stable is global in profile, with robust penetration in Eastern Europe and Asia (notably Japan and South Korea). And while penetration is comparatively weak in the Middle East and Latin America, both regions, with their highly favourable demographics, present opportunities for stronger positions going forward. China and India are also identified as core opportunity markets. </p>
<p>Now that Cadbury is in its sights, Kraft might consider that it has taken coffee as far as it wants and that the operational structure in place could work best for the company as an appetising value-added acquisition prize. Indeed, for the right type of large-scale company, with money to spend, there is clearly plenty of emerging market upside to offset sluggishness in the mature markets. And US$7 billion of annual retail sales is nothing to be sniffed at.</p>

<h2>Who are the possible buyers?</h2>
<p>It is worth considering that Starbucks, the world's leading coffee house chain, has a long-term licensing agreement in place with Kraft, which is geared to developing the Starbucks brand at a retail level. Earlier this year, the agreement was expanded in Western Europe to include France and Germany, two of the world's biggest coffee cultures. If you look at Starbucks' business model, there seems little doubt that a strong retail component would be no bad thing at all for a foodservice company that is visibly reaching maturity in its home US market (600 company-owned US stores were closed last year).</p>
<p>The question is whether or not Starbucks could afford to buy the coffee business of Kraft without undermining its foodservice arm. Growth has hit a brick wall in the US, but, crucially, the company has barely scratched the surface of opportunity in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. It has, therefore, a clearly defined medium to long-term growth target trajectory, with significant potential upside. Backing that up with a stronger retail presence in the industrialised markets might be the perfect complement. Hence, even if the coffers are not sufficiently full, financing the deal might not be too much of a problem. </p>
<p>And what about the big soft drinks companies? Increasingly, the beverage world operates strategically in terms of share of throat and wallet, which means factoring cross-industry competition between soft, hot, dairy and alcoholic drinks. According to a brand new upcoming report from Euromonitor International, hot coffee accounted for one in every 10 RTD litres of branded drinks consumed worldwide in 2009, making it the fifth biggest beverage category in the world, after tea, carbonates, bottled water and beer. And for the likes of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which are largely shy of significant hot drinks penetration, the addition of the world's second biggest coffee business to the portfolio could be route one to a dramatic shake up in the share-of-throat stakes.</p>
<p>Nothing is written in stone yet, but Kraft's bid for Cadbury is likely to be formalised imminently, and the drinks industry would be wise to look out for any potential side deals in the making. It might be the ideal moment to wake up and smell the coffee. </p>

Mergers signal heated interest in North American coffee pods market,"Though coffee pods represent less than 2% of retail ground coffee volume sales in North America, their popularity is growing, and a wave of recent acquisitions indicates that specialty coffee manufacturers should be acting now to stake their claim in this expanding market segment while they still can.","<p>Though coffee pods represent less than 2% of retail ground coffee volume sales in North America, their popularity is growing, and a wave of recent acquisitions indicates that specialty coffee manufacturers should be acting now to stake their claim in this expanding market segment while they still can.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Large manufacturers like Kraft Foods Inc, Nestlé SA, and Sara Lee Corp have all launched their own coffee pod systems in recent years, but the current US market leader is Keurig's K-Cup single serve system, owned since 2006 by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc.  Keurig has gained prominence in part due to offering a wide variety of coffees, often from licensees, and this kind of partnership has been mirrored by rivals such as Starbucks, which offers pods for Kraft's Tassimo system.</p>
<p>In 2009, Green Mountain has begun to consolidate these relationships through acquisitions, first purchasing the wholesale business of Tully's in March and then agreeing to purchase the Timothy's World Coffee brand and wholesale business in November.  Also in November, Peet's Coffee &Tea agreed to purchase Diedrich Coffee, a specialty coffee pod manufacturer, in a US$213 million deal.  Diedrich is Green Mountain's largest royalty partner, providing 15% of K-Cups to Keurig, according to the company.  Initially it was speculated that Green Mountain might make a rival bid, given the importance of Diedrich to its business, but this option now seems unlikely with the Timothy's acquisition.</p>
<h2>Overcoming regional limitations</h2>
<p>Many specialty coffee manufacturers have found it difficult to achieve the same kind of national distribution and brand awareness among consumers as their larger competitors.  In the retail market, large companies typically have existing relationships with supermarket chains and control more shelf space across several categories.  Some manufacturers utilize this strength through distribution partnerships with large players, but for those that cannot, sales growth has been much slower.  For example, Dunkin Donuts partnered with Procter & Gamble (and now JM Smucker Co) in 2007 to launch a version of its coffees into supermarkets and other retail outlets.  By 2008, retail value sales exceeded US$100 million, for a share of more than 2% of US retail fresh ground coffee.  Meanwhile no specialty player has more than 1% of sales, according to Euromonitor figures.</p>
<p>In the foodservice market, many specialty manufacturers also have branded chained coffee shops where their products are sold, but these are often concentrated in a particular region.  Issues of cost and logistics of the supply chain can be formidable roadblocks to smaller companies looking to achieve the kind of national presence of a Starbucks or Tim Horton's.  </p>
<p>Single serve coffee pods have thus emerged as an alternative route to consumers for these kinds of second tier manufacturers.   The newness and novelty of the brewing systems have allowed lesser known brands to establish a presence through pods much more quickly than in a traditional ground coffee format, though Starbucks and other big names are also popular.  The hefty price tag on the single serve machines themselves, often double the cost or more of regular coffee machines, also lends itself to a more premium coffee being used for brewing.</p>
<h2>New leaders emerging</h2>
<p>Green Mountain is a specialty coffee company that had encountered just this sort of difficulty, focusing on the production of higher priced fair trade organic coffees that gained a devoted following especially in the Northeastern US near its Vermont headquarters, but did not have the same kind of national presence as Kraft or Procter and Gamble.  With its newer focus on K-Cups, Green Mountain now has a viable national platform for its coffees.  The Timothy's Coffee acquisition, for US$157 million, will give the company a greater foothold in Canada through manufacturing and distribution assets.  Timothy's foodservice coffee specialist outlets will remain separately owned, but an existing five year supply agreement should help provide a guaranteed outlet for expansion, while the Timothy's, Emeril's, and Kahlua brands can now be fully integrated into Green Mountain's existing US distribution for K-Cups.  Similarly, Tully's coffee specialist outlets had been primarily concentrated in the Northwestern US, but now the brand becomes fully part of the national K-Cup portfolio.</p>
<p>Peet's is another regional coffee chain, with 190 US outlets chiefly located in the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington.  By acquiring Diedrich, Peet's gains its roasting and packaging facilities along with rights to the Diedrich Coffee, Coffee People, and Gloria Jean's single serve brands.  The new infrastructure will help the company increase capacity for future coffee pods production, and the existing Diedrich direct store delivery (DSD) system should help the Peet's brand gain more of a presence in areas outside its Western US base.</p>
<p>These kinds of alliances are now possible due to the continued emergence of pods within the North American market.  According to upcoming Euromonitor data, coffee pods retail volume sales are expected to grow a further 30% in the US and more than 100% in Canada from 2009-2014.  Coffee manufacturers looking to enter this segment through product launches or acquisitions may find the window of opportunity is closing, and should act quickly before no targets remain.</p>

Chávez takes control of Venezuelan coffee,"In November 2009, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez announced that he had nationalized coffee producers Fama de América and Cafea, and intended to take a majority stake in Café Madrid.  The move gives the Venezuelan government control of more than 50% of the country's coffee industry, and signals a continuation of tightened governmental role that has already been put in to effect in the electricity, cement, oil, and food sectors in Venezuela.","<p>In November 2009, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez announced that he had nationalized coffee producers Fama de América and Cafea, and intended to take a majority stake in Café Madrid.  The move gives the Venezuelan government control of more than 50% of the country's coffee industry, and signals a continuation of tightened governmental role that has already been put in to effect in the electricity, cement, oil, and food sectors in Venezuela.</p>

<p>The prices of standard coffee and other basic food and drinks products have been regulated since 2003. Regarding coffee, the controlled prices had not changed since 2005. Manufacturers, especially the largest ones, have declared that production costs are much higher than the price at which they are required to sell. The government-fixed price is US$5.90 per kg of raw coffee beans, while costs are estimated to run around US$8.30 per kg.  This provides little incentive to produce standard coffee and as a result, only 99 coffee plants were operating in 2009 compared to the 145 operating a year ago, according to the Superintendent of Silos, Warehouse and Agricultural Storage (SADA).</p>
<p>High coffee shortage levels have occurred, requiring imports of nearly 23 million kilograms in 2009.  After several requests made by the private sector at the end of 2008 the government increased the price of green coffee by 63% and a few weeks later adjusted the price of ground coffee. Still, these fixed prices remained below market value and will quickly become outdated in the context of Venezuela's high inflation. Official estimates of inflation were greater than 25% in 2008.</p>
<p>Smuggling has also played an important role in the competitive landscape of this business, albeit regarding specifically contraband from Venezuela to other countries. In the past year reports of smuggling have increased, attributed to the situation caused by the low profitability of producing traditional roasted coffee (under the price regulation). It is believed that some companies have been sending the product illegally to countries such as Colombia, where they can get better prices, and this has contributed to shortages of the product on local store shelves, despite the fact that problems with the harvest were not particularly severe.</p>
<h2>The new model</h2>
<p>Representatives from SADA have stated that the nationalization effort will lead to a more regional distribution of ground coffee, with local plants supplying the areas where they are located, to better balance the market.  Under the new plan, Fama de América and Café Madrid will supply half the domestic market with the other half supplied by small and medium sized coffee roasters.  A further possibility would be the creation of a government controlled nationally distributed brand such as Café Venezuela.  SADA expects the move to help realize efficiencies in freight and transportation costs, though how it will address the price disparity issue remains unclear.</p>
<h2>Government intervention commonplace in coffee category</h2>
<p>In 2008, the Venezuelan government continued its “Plan Café” initiative in order to benefit small producers in the coffee sector. The Plan Café is a plan intended to provide training and better production conditions for the smaller players in the market as well as to improve the quality of the locally produced coffee; it also involves the construction of a better physical infrastructure, such as access roads, in the cultivated areas. Likewise, the state has formed a strategic coffee reserve to face any potential periods of shortage in the harvest and to change the current market structure in which more than 80% of ground coffee is processed by private companies.</p>
<p>Thanks to initiatives like the Plan Café, better living conditions and improvement in the production processes have benefited many small farmers throughout the country. In 2008, the government had already delivered more than 15,000 loans to produce coffee on more than 29,000 hectares, which constitutes approximately 14% of the country's total coffee producing surface. Over 70,000 people have been trained in the coffee industry, a figure that includes more than 55,000 farmers. It has also delivered trucks to farmers and built communication ways in agricultural sectors. Production increased in 2008 and, according to government figures, the initiative resulted in more than 1.5 million quintales (bags of 46 kilograms) being produced in 2008.</p>
<p>However, the government's involvement has not been without its critics. For example, there are complaints that 40% of the houses handed over to farmers need to be repaired or need replacement. There are also rumours that the strategic coffee reserve that the state had begun to accumulate in this year was fully utilised due to the shortages suffered at the end of 2008, and handed over to the roasters to fill the shelves in retail outlets.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>In 2008, the Plan Café provided just 9% of the total national volume of coffee; however, in the future, thanks to the support from the government, small producers and roasters, it will become much stronger, and, ultimately, will also strengthen coffee brands such as Café Venezuela, which is directly sponsored by the government. The plan is meant to provide enough products for domestic consumption and to increase the levels of exports from Venezuela as well.</p>
<p>The move to assert government control over coffee production is part of the Venezuelan government's plan for ensuring so-called ""food sovereignty"". There is no guarantee that the state will respond quickly to the demands of the producers though, and it is likely that shortages and inflated costs will continue to characterize the competitive landscape for coffee in the months ahead.  In order to operate successfully in Venezuela, constant negotiations with and lobbying of the government will be needed.  Flavoured coffees and iced coffee are two products that have given a boost in recent years to local producers like Fama de América, and remaining companies in the private sector will have to compete through this sort of innovation to help them diversify the risk of producing price-controlled standard coffee, which seems to be here to stay.  </p>

The development of Britain's café culture over the past ten years has created habits of a daily coffee indulgence that have been sustained through the current recession.  This familiarity with premium quality coffee is also creating new opportunities for at home coffee brewing.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Early closures have minimal impact</h2>
<p>Chained coffee shops represented 60% of on trade coffee volume sales in the UK in 2008, and managed to slightly increase that share in 2009, according to upcoming Euromonitor International data.  After many years of unrestrained growth, there were some casualties of the economic downturn in 2009.  Coffee Republic fell into administration in July, and was followed in October 2009 by BB's Coffee & Muffins.  Both quickly emerged with new owners however, and have stated expansion plans for 2010.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile several larger chains continued to see improved results in 2009.  Market leader Costa Coffee announced a 73% increase in operating profit for the six months ending in August, and opened its 1000th UK outlet in September.  Starbucks announced in January that it would close stores in Ireland and the UK, but actually grew the overall number of its outlets in the region by the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>This kind of sustained success shows that consumers are still responding to the value proposition offered by coffee specialists, where a quick indulgence and relaxing atmosphere can be had for only a few pounds.  Strategies like added Wi-Fi and free refills on standard coffee help encourage patrons to stay for longer periods of time, creating what one industry player has termed “the modern form of the pub”.  </p>
<p>Another reason growth continues unabated is the further opening of outlets in smaller cities and rural areas. Saturation point appears to have been reached in London, with Starbucks operating 150 outlets within a 5-mile radius. Expansion in the provincial regions of the UK will in turn be followed by the establishment of chained specialist coffee shops outlets or counters in new locations such as supermarkets/hypermarkets, bookstores, estate agents and even bookmakers. </p>
<h2>Translating to retail gains</h2>
<p>Rather than drawing attention away from at home coffee preparation, the popularity of coffee specialist chains has provided an opportunity for the retail sector as consumers' expectations of coffee made at home rises to what they might expect out of home.  Manufacturers continue to respond with a greater array of quality coffees and convenient formats, such as single serve coffee pods, and as a result retail sales growth of coffee accelerated in 2009 in both value and volume terms.</p>
<p> 	Instant coffee maintains the lion's share of coffee sales, accounting for 80% of the category. Instant coffee manufacturers have tried to keep up with specialist coffee shop trends by launching flavoured sachets of different coffee shop drinks, such as latté, mocha and cappuccino. But demand for these products is falling as more consumers trade up to coffee pod machines in an attempt to re-create the authentic specialist coffee shop taste at home. Weaker brands like Kraft's Maxwell House are being cleared out by retailers to make way for the increasingly fragmented, but faster growing fresh coffee subcategory. Kraft has also been heavily pushing its Tassimo machine and the partnership agreement between Kraft Foods and Starbucks which sees Starbucks coffee being prepared in the Tassimo machine is good news for both parties and will serve to reinforce the ongoing adoption of the at home café culture.</p>
<p>The credit crunch may still further curb spending, but some FMCG sectors continue to experience more of an impact than others, with consumers most likely continue to spend on food and drink in some shape or form. They key for coffee specialists and supermarkets alike is to reach out to those who spend, perhaps promoting products and tailoring offers to cater to specific needs. Value messages are critical in communicating to the public. Products such as single serve coffee pods and Rainforest Alliance or Fair Trade coffee may come at a price premium when compared to other coffees, but are still considerably less expensive than big ticket items like travel or electronics.  Coffee can therefore have a potential for increased sales as luxury-seeking consumers cut back on larger purchases. Consumers have proven willing to stick to their established habits of coffee purchasing and should be encouraged to continue this loyalty in new consumption occasions. Loyal Starbucks customers, for instance, might be more inclined to try a Starbucks branded Tassimo pod coffee at home.  Loyal Cafe Nero customers may purchase their hot drinks at convenience stores while they are picking up their lunch. Consumers will continue to spend in spite of rising prices, buying what they perceive as indulgent and premium to satisfy their individual needs. However, this is only so long as coffee remains an affordable luxury.</p>

Whitbread’s Costa Coffee arm in talks to purchase Poland’s Coffeeheaven,"Buoyed by continued strong sales in the teeth of a global recession, Costa Coffee has gone on offense, with reports Friday linking the chain to a potential £32million (US$52million) buyout of Coffeeheaven, a chain with a strong and growing presence in Central Europe, above all in Poland. ","<p>Buoyed by continued strong sales in the teeth of a global recession, Costa Coffee has gone on offense, with reports Friday linking the chain to a potential £32million (US$52million) buyout of Coffeeheaven, a chain with a strong and growing presence in Central Europe, above all in Poland. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The move marks a major shift for Coffeeheaven, which operates around 90 outlets in Central Europe and posted sales of more than US$30 million in 2008. While company officials had previously expressed confidence in the company's ability to compete with the largest global coffee chains, noting Coffeeheaven's unique offer and deep knowledge of Central European consumers, the sheer depth of the downturn may have altered their calculations, with the company suffering a major drop in same-store sales due to sharply falling traffic in the Czech Republic. For Costa Coffee, acquiring Coffeeheaven would give the chain a strong foothold in markets like Poland, where specialist coffee shops are now a US$100 million sector. </p>
<h2>A strong regional player</h2>
<p>While Costa Coffee does have a presence in Central Europe, it lags behind that of Coffeeheaven, with just 14 outlets in Poland to Coffeeheaven's 62, while a similar gap prevails in markets like the Czech Republic and Hungary. A tie-up with the region's leading specialist coffee shop chain would put Costa well ahead of international rivals like Starbucks in a number of fast-growing markets, particularly Poland, which has weathered the economic downturn extraordinarily well, with GDP growth expected to remain positive for 2009. While Coffeeheaven has not been immune to the slowdown, its dominant position in Poland has helped to shore up sales, with revenues up 16% in fiscal 2009 to £12.5 million (US$20.2 million). Though Costa Coffee's rumoured US$52 million offer represents a substantial premium over 2009 sales, it would increase the company's outlet presence in Central Europe fivefold, and is substantial smaller than some of the valuations quoted for the company in the summer of 2008, when rumours swirled around a potential acquisition by Starbucks. </p>
<p>For Coffeeheaven the deal is somewhat more surprising, given past statements in which company officials have expressed strong confidence in the company's ability to compete in Central Europe while remaining independent, a claim bolstered by the chain's strong, and growing, outlet presence there. At the same time, the company had previously announced in June of this year it would be undertaking a strategic review, as well as entering into preliminary talks with a potential acquisition suitor. Given tepid demand this year outside of the core Polish market, it seems likely Coffeeheaven's directors decided a sale now would provide greater shareholder value than waiting for an uptick in demand in the  economies of markets like the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Latvia, all of which have been hit hard by the global downturn, further pressuring margins already under pressure due to the company's ambitious expansion over the last two years. </p>

<h3>A major foothold in a region with room to grow</h3>
<p>A successful acquisition of Coffeeheaven would place Costa Coffee firmly in the driver's seat in the US$756 million Eastern European specialist coffee shops market, complementing its 2008 entry into Russia, where the chain now operates 17 outlets. What's more, Coffeeheaven is far from a small startup; it boasts both high brand awareness and a distribution infrastructure which few chains in the region can match, having opened its first Polish outlet in mid-2000. With specialist coffee shop sales in Eastern Europe set to surpass US$1 billion by 2012, the successful integration of Coffeeheaven would leave Costa Coffee well-positioned to make continued gains in a market which continues to grow and where capable competitors remain few and far between. </p>
<p>That said, the devil remains very much in the details. Consumer foodservice mergers are comparatively rare, and successfully integrating two service cultures can be difficult. Coffeeheaven holds significant brand equity in its core Polish market, yet it seems unlikely that Costa, already an established global brand, would fail to eventually convert Coffeeheaven's existing shops to Costa Coffee-branded outlets. The real value to Costa Coffee of any merger will likely be the head start it gains on rivals in Central Europe, as well as a broad portfolio of attractive existing locations. </p>

Lack of global presence challenges RTD tea and coffee in the recession,"RTD tea and RTD coffee are undoubtedly among the up and coming sectors within beverages. However, the limited geographical coverage of both products will restrict medium term growth, especially in the face of the global economic slowdown.  ","<p>RTD tea and RTD coffee are undoubtedly among the up and coming sectors within beverages. However, the limited geographical coverage of both products will restrict medium term growth, especially in the face of the global economic slowdown.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Concentration at the top for RTD tea</h2>
<p>The top three markets in the world, China, Japan and the US, accounted collectively for some 70% of global demand in 2009. Going forward, the big challenge for the industry is, therefore, to unlock new markets. This will be difficult over the short term due to the negative constraint of the economic recession in key potential growth regions.</p>
<p>In value sales terms, Japan is by far the largest market, and is also the most mature market.  Japanese producers generate value in the RTD tea sector through functional launches, such as Kirin Bunkai Cha, which claims to tackle “metabolic syndrome” with de-bittered tochu tea, oolong tea and ukon tea. Other growth areas include unsweetened oolong and sweetened black tea; however, unsweetened green tea continued to be the most popular type of RTD tea in Japan in 2009. Innovative products, like anti-ageing functional RTD tea, for example, Kirin I-Tea with antioxidant astaxanthin, are attracting older consumers, who generally prefer to prepare their own tea at home, but are increasingly appreciating the convenience and range of flavours and tea variants on offer. </p>
<p>One of the leading growth markets in terms of absolute value in 2009 was the US. In this market, RTD tea grew at a faster rate than soft drinks as a whole, driven by increased concern over health and wellness and something of a consumer malaise surrounding carbonates, especially “cola-fatigue” among higher income consumers.</p>
<p>There are also opportunities within middle income regions, such as Russia and Latin America. Rising incomes among the richer sections of society and the importing of health trends from high-income countries is driving the growth of the sector from extremely low per capita levels.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Top Ten Global RTD Tea Value Markets, 2009</h4>
<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\ca2cf529-1dbd-46e3-b74a-2cfa128d002c.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h2>RTD tea builds on health positioning</h2>
<p>The RTD tea category has so far proven to be relatively resilient, even excluding the major markets of China, Japan and US.  The category saw an increase of 7% volume sales growth in 2009 according to the latest Euromonitor International estimates, and its positioning as a healthy beverage alternative will stand it in good stead for similar increases in 2010.</p>
<p>The key factor is its healthy image. The fact that the health and wellness trend and the drive to combat obesity persist during a recessionary period are factors behind the RTD tea's positive outlook.  In China, the RTD tea category offers potential, as consumers are still gravitating towards affordable indulgences.  A healthier image will also continue to attract consumers looking to switch from highly sugarised drinks, like carbonates, in countries such as the US and Australia.  However, throughout most of Western Europe, the category will in the short to medium term remain one of the high profile casualties of the recession in soft drinks.</p>
<p>The growth of RTD tea shows no sign of abating in Asia-Pacific. Currently per capita volume consumption in the region is very uneven. In Thailand, it stood at a mere 1.8 litres in 2009, considerably lower than in other developing countries, such as China (7.8 litres), Indonesia (6.3 litres), and Vietnam (4.9 litres).  However, North America, and the US in particular, is one of the most interesting markets to watch, as US per capita consumption (11.6 litres) ranks among the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Outside Asia-Pacific, Russia is an important growth market, albeit from a low base, and should continue to be viewed as a strong opportunity in the medium to long term. Its strong hot tea consumption culture provides a solid base on which to build. </p>
<p>Sales through on trade outlets such as restaurants and fast food chains represent a limited portion of overall global sales, but are increasingly being used by manufacturers as a way to gain more exposure for RTD tea.  In China on-trade, green RTD tea is the most common mixer for whisky, and the ever-increasing demand for whisky in bars and pubs has benefited sales of green RTD tea. Another important RTD tea type consumed in the on-trade is herbal tea. For instance, Wong Lo Kat Herbal Tea remains popular in “hot pot” restaurants, as it is perceived to be effective in balancing out the effects of spicy food. In the US, RTD tea sales are still oriented to the off-trade, for take-home use, but on-trade sales increased at a faster rate than off-trade volumes in 2009, thanks to the expansion of packaged teas in fast food and other restaurant outlets.   In Japan though, the on-trade is performing badly, with year-on-year volume declines. Most consumers opt for iced tea prepared on-site or for hot tea in on-trade outlets. The rise of specialist tea houses has further encouraged this trend, with consumers preferring the premium fresh-brewed tea available at these outlets.</p>
<p>The current economic downturn is expected to continue to restrict consumer confidence, and ultra premium RTD teas will be the hardest hit category. Successful products should focus on naturally healthy positioning and health benefits to drive volumes and positioning over the short to medium term is key.  Effective product segmentation will be critical, with new flavours and tea types to lead the way.  Manufacturers will also have to focus outside core markets and look to growth in second tier RTD tea markets.</p>
<h2>RTD coffee sales lack global reach</h2>
<p>In percentage terms, RTD coffee is expected to be the most affected soft drinks category by the economic downturn during 2009-2010. Over 75% of RTD coffee volume sales are derived from Japan and the category therefore lacks the geographical diversity to alleviate developed market declines.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Top 5 Global RTD Coffee Markets, 2009</h4>
<p>US$ million<img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\9369a167-0a87-4fd4-844c-52c906039aab.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<p>Since sales are so heavily concentrated in Japan, the United States, and South Korea, the category's fortunes are tied more directly to the moves of a few global leading manufacturers.  Rather than building brands on their own, RTD coffee players are increasingly looking to strategic alliances with existing companies to develop brands, and more recently they have been extending the geographic coverage of these alliance deals to increase their income.</p>
<p>Frappuccino is owned by Starbucks; however, the bottled RTD coffee Frappuccino is produced and distributed by The North American Coffee Partnership, jointly owned by Starbucks and PepsiCo. The two partners are working beyond North America and are even looking to countries which may not currently have Starbucks outlets.  PepsiCo Inc's other joint venture with Unilever to distribute tea products, Pepsi-Lipton International, now officially covers over 50 countries.  Pepsi is likely to follow a similar path in RTD coffee with Starbucks.   PepsiCo's US-based premium juice brand Naked Juice is now available in select Starbucks outlets internationally to strengthen PepsiCo's share in juice in foodservice. However, PepsiCo still does not have its own mega brands in RTD tea and coffee. </p>
<p>Soft drinks leader Coca-Cola Co also has pursued this path of alliances for its RTD coffees.  The company launched a Caribou branded RTD coffee in the US in 2007, based on the coffee specialist chain.  Coca-Cola also set up a joint venture with Italian coffee specialist illycafé, named ilko Coffee International. The premium RTD coffee brand illy issimo (owned by illycafé) is being rolled out in many European markets and the USA. The Coca-Cola system handles production and distribution of these brands under licence. </p>
<p>Other companies have instead chosen to invest directly in RTD coffee manufacturers, such as the recent 2009 deal for Sapporo to take a 22% stake in Pokka Corp.  Pokka, ranked ninth in RTD coffee in Japan, saw its position in Japan's overall soft drinks market falling in recent years. Pokka is also present in many international markets such as Russia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and many Asian countries with its RTD beverages. Pokka may benefit from Sapporo's investment to sustain its position in the domestic market and seize overseas growth opportunities. Sapporo is considering forming a three-way business alliance with Meiji Holdings, which has a 22% stake in Pokka. The deal with Meiji could eventually develop into a capital tie-up as the three firms are considering joint supply and development of products.</p>
<p>In the short term, growth in RTD coffee sales will likely have to come from existing companies and alliances like this, as it will prove too costly and time consuming to build new RTD coffee sales in markets where coffee  is not already a prominent part of the culture.  Leveraging existing strengths of branding, production, and distribution between companies will remain key the weathering the economic recession.</p>

Building a new popularity for coffee in Peru,"Coffee is the most consumed hot drink in the world, but still faces strong competition for growth in many countries where there is a longstanding tea drinking culture.

Peru represents one country meeting the challenge of creating a new demand for coffee among consumers more accustomed to tea, and can offer some lessons for manufacturers facing this difficulty in other markets.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Peru's coffee per capita consumption is approximately 0.5 kg, which is one of the lowest in the Latin America region. Over 95% of all coffee produced there is for export markets in North America, Europe, and Asia, and is usually of a premium quality.  For instance, although Peruvian coffee production represents only 2% of the world's volume output, Peru is the global leader in exports of organic coffee.  Despite this emphasis on external sales, total domestic volume sales of coffee are predicted to grow by 25% to reach 17 million tonnes by 2014, the second highest forecast growth in the region behind Ecuador.  This will be achieved through a combination of efforts from both domestic and international forces</p>
<h2>Government shines a spotlight on coffee</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most visible boost to coffee consumption has come from government policies designed to boost domestic demand for coffee or aid farmers to increase the productivity of their coffee fields. For example, in 2009 the Ministry of Agriculture assigned US$10 million for a credit programme to help farmers update old fields where coffee is cultivated. This initiative was carried out by the Agriculture Bank (Banco Agropecuario) through a signed agreement with the National Board of Coffee (Junta Nacional de Café). In addition, the Production Ministry continued to foment coffee consumption with activities such as National Day of Coffee which began to be celebrated in Peru in 2008, on every fourth Friday of August. During 2009, the Production Ministry sponsored a tasting session carried out in popular Larcomar mall, where consumers could try different varieties of coffee and receive information about its beneficial health effects.</p>
<h2>Domestic producers take new initiatives </h2>
<p>Domestic brands dominate the landscape of coffee sales in Peru and are therefore in a good position to reach new consumers.  One example of such a company is Altomayo Perú SAC, which belongs to the Perales Huancaruna group (Corporación PERHUSA), one of the major agricultural business companies in Peru. Altomayo has been harvesting coffee in Cajamarca and Amazonas in the north of Peru (Highlands) since 1960.  The company has built up a good relationship with the more than 40,000 families who serve as coffee providers through local farms, by investing in the improvement and development of the fields and updating their farming practices to help increase production.  This effort dedicated to reinforcing its relationship with its farmers has helped them to feel that Altomayo recognises their contribution in the value chain, and sets them apart from competing companies.</p>
<p>Though they are focused on exports like most Peruvian coffee manufacturers, Altomayo has taken unique steps to grow its domestic brands as well.  The company has grown its share to reach 22% in 2009 by offering different products to different segments of coffee drinkers:  its Altomayo brand to upper- and middle-income consumers and its Elbo brand to lower-income consumers.  The company signed an agreement in 2003 with Unilever Andina Perú SA to use its distribution channels in order to increase its penetration to as many sales points as possible. It is also signed exclusive deals with fast food chains which agreed to sell only its products. </p>
<p>In July 2008, Altomayo Perú SAC launched Café Altomayo, a coffee shop in the Mega Plaza mall, offering innovative and creative hot drinks that combine coffee beans with unusual ingredients such as pisco (a typical Peruvian alcoholic drink) or mocha with caramel. In this way, the company has targeted a wider and younger public.   It developed a new package with a blue colour for its Café Altomayo brand which set it apart in retail outlets, since traditional colours for coffee are combinations of red, black and brown. The company was also the first to develop glass packaging which gives the impression of greater purity and higher quality. Altomayo introduced the smallest packages in the coffee market with sachets of 8g. These allow the typical consumer to make daily purchases and help them afford an higher quality natural coffee.</p>
<p>In 2009, the company focused a nearly US$1 million investment into growing its Café Altomayo business. Sales of Altomayo within its coffee outlets increased by 30% compared to the previous year, as the company opened more coffee shops not only in Lima, but also in Trujillo, Tarapoto and Pucallpa airports. </p>
<h2>Expanding café culture beyond Lima</h2>
<p>This expansion to the provinces or second tier cities in Peru represents an important step in exposing more consumers to coffee, and is one area where international operators could quickly make some gains from their investment.  Despite the recent slowdown of the Peruvian economy, on-trade volume consumption only represented 35% of total coffee consumption in 2009 and has a lot of space to grow.  </p>
<p>Starbucks is the most common on-trade chained specialist coffee outlet and had 20 stores in Lima and one store in Trujillo by the end of 2009, with plans for further expansion outside of Lima during 2009-2014. Other international coffee shops increasing in popularity were Havana Café and Café Britt, which opened two new coffee shops in two five-star hotels located in the provinces. </p>
<p>In 2009, more shopping centres opened both in Lima and the main cities in provinces, such as Piura, Cajamarca, Trujillo, Arequipa, Chiclayo, which contributed to increased coffee sales both through off-trade and on-trade channels.  This represents an opportunity for international players and Peruvian operators like Altomayo, Pastipan and La Mora alike to capture the attention of an emerging middle class population that might be more willing to try a higher quality coffee.</p>
<h2>Instant coffee appeals to on the go consumers</h2>
<p>In terms of off-trade value sales, instant coffee experienced the fastest growth any coffee category in Peru with a 7% increase in 2009. This was due to two reasons: firstly, despite the fact that instant coffee as a category carries the highest unit prices, it offers a wide range of small packages: from flexible packages of 12 g, priced between n/s 0.6 -1. These formats are affordable for people looking to limit their immediate expenses, and are also practical for people who do not frequently consume coffee. In comparison with the large packages of fresh coffee, the smallest one containing 250 g is priced between n/s 4 -5. The second factor is that as Peruvian consumers are living busier lifestyles –especially in urban areas - they look for products which are quicker and easier to prepare, benefiting consumption of instant coffee over fresh coffee.</p>
<p>Instant coffee can also be a category where international manufacturers can make an impression through unique points of sale, as consumers are more willing to try a single serve product with a relatively cheaper price point.  For example, during the winter, Nescafé also promotes its products through coffee tricycles in the streets, which are strategically placed in high traffic avenues and where cups of coffee (made with Nescafé) are sold for n/s 1- 1.5.</p>
<p>In Peru, a lack of established tradition around coffee consumption can be a formidable barrier to domestic coffee sales growth.  Peruvian manufacturers have met this challenge with measures to expand coffee's appeal to a younger, more affluent generation through higher quality products, greater availability in channels beyond traditional bodegas, reaching points of sales outside the capital city of Lima, and offering a greater variety of sizes and prices for coffee to appeal to different segments of the population.  International coffee manufacturers are often faced with a similar dilemma in other markets, and would do well to emulate the success stories of Peru, either through their own initiatives or through partnerships with local players looking to take the same types of steps.</p>

Changing Russian lifestyles heightens demand for specialist coffee shops,"Specialist coffee shops in Russia have seen tremendous growth particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg where the customer base in these cities consists mainly of foreign employees and office workers with busier schedules, who are giving rise to a new trend of taking their morning coffee and breakfast outside the home.","<p>Specialist coffee shops in Russia have seen tremendous growth particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg where the customer base in these cities consists mainly of foreign employees and office workers with busier schedules, who are giving rise to a new trend of taking their morning coffee and breakfast outside the home.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>More traditional tea-drinking rituals, in a country renowned for its prolific tea consumption, are no longer the obvious choice for a growing number of professionals, who are becoming accustomed to the convenience and sophistication of coffee drinking in the increasing number of specialist coffee shops popping up all over the major cities. This is supported by the long period of economic growth, increasing urbanisation and a more service-orientated retail climate underpinned by greater awareness of Western consumer trends.</p>
<p>These consumers are also clearly buying into the trend for global sophistication and culture, as the variety of coffee formats explodes exponentially catering to consumers, for whom a basic black coffee is no longer acceptable. Coffee shops are then likely to become as ubiquitous on the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg as they are in other Western European consumer markets.</p>
<p>Cafés are the natural choice for consumers when it comes to choosing a breakfast location, as coffee is the first drink of the day for many consumers. Product development is therefore strong in theses outlets, with consumers in the larger cities already becoming familiar with the formats and styles of coffee that are available, particularly given the presence of international chains. </p>
<h2>Chains expected to lead the way in specialist coffee shop expansion</h2>
<p>The growth of coffee shops and coffee drinking is set to gather pace in Russia, as social, cultural and economic factors eventually lend themselves to supporting such a consumer market. McDonald's recognises this growing trend and has invested in advertising its morning menus, encouraging consumers to break with the traditional habits of eating breakfast at home, and instead go to a McDonald's outlet. The campaign is particularly aimed at young and single people. In addition, McDonald's is opening more McCafé outlets, where cakes and desserts will be served, thus attracting more consumers. It is also opening additional drive-thru establishments and more standard outlets, which will be open around the clock. These factors will make the Russian market one of the most dynamic for the company.</p>
<p>Chained brands will rely heavily on marketing and promotion, representing considerable competition for independent players, which will struggle to compete not only on the basis of coffee prices but rising rent costs and lower levels of recognition. This indeed could also pose a problem to multinational giants, which could struggle to find new, cost-effective locations in which to be based. However, with the population growing in the major cities, an increasing number of urban professionals leading hectic lives, and a developing breakfast culture, they may well still find it profitable.</p>
<h2>Despite economic slowdown, specialist coffee shop prospects remain positive</h2>
<p>The coffee environment has not yet reached saturation, leaving plenty of scope for those able to capitalise on the opportunities, although this is likely to come in the form of the already dominant market leaders, namely domestic players Shokoladnitsa and Coffee House as well as expanding multinationals Costa Coffee and Starbucks. These operators will continue to primarily target middle class consumers, professionals, affluent single people and foreigners, particularly those on the move. </p>
<p>Consumers' increasing sophistication with regard to speciality coffees will support the development of a café culture in Russia. As such it is likely that cafés will become a permanent fixture on Russian high streets. In fact at a global level, Russia is expected to be the fourth largest contributor to global specialist coffee shop growth from 2008 to 2013, adding over US$200 million in constant value sales. </p>
<p>The rising popularity of speciality coffees, however, will also be vulnerable to changeable consumer tastes, particularly as new options appear on all sides and prices continue to rise. They will also benefit from increased sophistication regarding tea and other beverages, as well as the emerging culture for early breakfast on the go. </p>

McCafé revitalises Germany’s foodservice coffee sales,"If Nespresso has revolutionised the way German coffee drinkers make a cup of coffee at home, McCafé has come to the rescue of Germany's foodservice coffee sales.","<p>If Nespresso has revolutionised the way German coffee drinkers make a cup of coffee at home, McCafé has come to the rescue of Germany's foodservice coffee sales.</p>

<p>Western European consumers may have been cautious in purchasing expensive holidays and other big-ticket household items over the past 24 months, but many of them have refused to compromise on their coffee consumption. According to Euromonitor International's latest research, coffee in Western Europe recorded positive total volume growth of 0.6% over 2008/2009, a period in which the region faced its deepest recession since World War II. Germany (1.1%), Europe's largest coffee market, outpaced average regional volume growth thanks to strong sales in its foodservice channel. Importantly, the year-on-year growth rate of foodservice coffee sales during the recession in Germany was actually stronger than before the crisis. McCafé has made an instrumental contribution to this result. Euromonitor International looks at the state of the market and the underlying potential of McCafé in Europe.</p>
<h2>McCafé – low-cost expansion and full urban coverage</h2>
<p>According to Euromonitor International research, while the economic downturn negatively affected the operations of full-service restaurants and hotels, it had very little impact on cafés and coffee bars. The latter are positioned at the low end of the price spectrum and are also very much ingrained in the German lifestyle, particularly in urban areas. During difficult financial times, many German consumers chose to reduce the frequency with which they dine in full-service restaurants, but continue to meet friends in cafés and coffee bars as this is an integral part of their lifestyle. </p>
<p>In Germany, chained specialist coffee shops achieved 2% growth in volume sales of coffee over 2008/2009 in contrast to the marginal growth of other foodservice outlets (0.5%), according to Euromonitor International data. McDonald's Deutschland Inc, in fact, accelerated its expansion in terms of number of McCafé outlets over this period as it saw its McCafé concept being well received. By the end of 2008, the number of outlets in Germany alone totalled 540. Across Europe, the number of outlets reached 1,000 in 2009.</p>
<p>McCafé has been a strategic tool for the burger retailer to generate extra revenue and sustain overall growth. Typically, McCafé outlets are located inside existing McDonald's restaurants but have a separate counter and are more comfortably furnished. This low-cost market entry strategy is designed to attract footfall to the restaurants as consumers seek value for money when meeting friends and family. With this extra concept, McDonald's can also sell more products such as desserts, while patrons linger for a longer time. So far, the rapid expansion of McCafé has proved that the concept is able to generate additional revenue for McDonald's and franchisees have been quick to adapt as well. Location-wise, compared with rival companies, which often focus on first-tier cities, McCafé has ventured into second-tier towns and even rural areas, firstly to avoid direct competition with big players such as Tchibo, and secondly to achieve maximum exposure to consumers around the country.</p>
<p>The success of the McCafé concept has also highlighted the importance of strategic alliances between foodservice and coffee companies. In view of the supply chain, the increasing scale of coffee operations at McCafé is being underpinned by the mega coffee supplier Kraft. It is Kraft's ability to provide reliable and large volumes of coffee that has made McCafé's expansion possible. Kraft's supply of fairtrade coffee to McCafé is probably not the most essential ingredient for success, but it does tap into the ethical consumption trend. This is important as the McDonald's Group continues to work on being associated with ethical and social responsibility. In light of this growth momentum, McDonald's has the ambition to become “the No1 coffee seller in Europe” over the short term. </p>

<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Germany Coffee Volume Year-on-year Growth %</h4>
<p>%<img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\5b2e9fe9-8708-49e2-a82a-52a595ea8f6a.png""></p>

<h2>Tchibo being squeezed </h2>
<p>Given McCafé's aggression and the economic slowdown, Tchibo continued to lose ground to McCafé over 2008/2009 in Germany. Outside of its home market, Tchibo has scaled back its operations by cutting down the number of outlets which did not meet expectations. Domestically, Tchibo is also undergoing restructuring and stopped opening new outlets between 2006 and 2008, a necessary step following years of aggressive expansion. McCafé, however, recorded a net increase of 326 units in Germany over the same period.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International's German analyst commented that it is highly likely that Tchibo will lose its market leadership by value in the chained café channel soon amid aggression from American- and Italian-style cafés. Ranked third in terms of number of units, Starbucks is also expanding rapidly in Germany. The combined force of McCafé and Starbucks is powerful enough to cannibalise sales from traditional restaurants and independent cafés. Independent cafés are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with the setting and atmosphere of McCafé and Starbucks outlets, which are particularly popular with young people. This demonstrates the importance of innovation and a flexible business approach even for established coffee players. No business should feel complacent in the face of competition from all sorts of directions. </p>
<h2>Prospects</h2>
<p>Euromonitor International forecasts that chained cafés are far from reaching saturation and the immediate outlook is still bright. Germany is expected to see positive growth in volume sales of coffee through the foodservice channel over 2009/2010, and far better than that of predicted regional growth. </p>
<p>Having realised the potential for growth, many chained companies are investing in new locations in order to remain competitive. Both smaller and larger chains will seek outlet openings in locations that focus on takeaway services, especially in areas with a high concentration of young professionals, such as city centres, shopping malls and business parks. It may be hard for these competitors to beat McCafé on the pricing front, but their focus could be on a larger selection of products, higher-quality products, or the availability of additional services that McDonald's is not able to offer due to its limited physical size. However, pricing will remain the crucial factor in attracting and retaining consumers. The latest consumer survey pinpoints that the easiest way for cafés/bars to lose customers is by increasing prices drastically. Therefore, when determining coffee prices, café operators will need to play safe and not breach certain price thresholds. Some players are negotiating new distribution deals with various foodservice operators. Tchibo, for example, has started to cooperate with Nordsee, which sells Tchibo coffee in its chain of restaurants. </p>
<p>McCafé has its strongest presence in Germany and Australia. Western Europe will likely be a strong focus for McCafé expansion as many McDonald's outlets have already been redesigned or plan to be (a requirement for the addition of a McCafé). While the new outlet designs help to appeal to older demographic groups , the McCafé concept hopes to also attract young consumers looking for a place to socialise. Benefiting from its already aspirational brand positioning and prime outlet placement, the McCafé concept will likely be a success in Eastern Europe, which is expected to see a return to growth for disposable incomes once economies improve.</p>

The company intends to be in 7,250 outlets by September 2010.  The move follows a similar deal with Subway that began in test markets in 2009 and is also scheduled to expand in 2010.  The decision to enter into fast food coffee marks a new step for Starbucks, and is a further indication that an emerging price tier of inexpensive foodservice coffee is likely to be the primary battleground for US coffee sales in the near future. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Three tiers emerge as consumers look for coffee on the go</h2>
<p>When it comes to choices for the US coffee consumer, the price extremes have long been well defined.  Among the cheapest options are instant coffees, preferred for convenience but perceived to have a lower quality.  These comprise the smallest portion of coffee sales in the US and volume sales have been in decline since 1999, according to Euromonitor International data.  Fresh coffee is typically slightly more expensive but the market is already saturated with several national brands, and has offered little room for product innovation.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is premium, portable coffee led for more than two decades by Starbucks.  Starbucks and the emergence of the coffee specialist chain have represented a revolution in foodservice coffee, but drinks at a $4-$5 price point are still inaccessible to many consumers.  There was still a need for a convenient foodservice coffee option at a more standard price level, and convenience stores and fast food coffees in years past did not have the quality consumers were looking for.</p>
<p>Without an existing set of established successful brands, this area of standard priced foodservice coffee increasingly drew the attention of major manufacturers.  Bakery fast food outlets like Dunkin Donuts and Tim Horton's began to emphasize their coffees over their baked goods in the early part of the decade.  Convenience stores upgraded their coffee quality, sometimes purchasing ready-made coffee solutions from brands like Kraft's Gevalia and Maxwell House or JM Smucker's Folgers and Millstone. 7-Eleven added functional components like ginseng and extra caffeine to some of its coffees.       </p>
<p>Finally, McDonald's made a major splash in 2009 through the launch of its McCafé coffees.  Billed as a premium coffee, the traditional drinks like lattes and mochas retail for about $2-$3, still below a Starbucks or similar coffee specialist outlet.  So far McCafé has been a success for the company in the US, helping McDonald's post a slight 1% sales increase in 2009 even as the country only begins to emerge from a recession.</p>
<h2>Underutilised brand fulfils a need</h2>
<p>Starbucks sales were also adversely hit during the recent recession, as consumers lost their jobs and were less willing to pay for a premium coffee.  In this climate, the company has searched for ways to reach a more cost conscious consumer, and this is why it is now turning to its Seattle's Best brand, which has traditionally been priced slightly below Starbucks in its outlets.</p>
<p>Starbucks purchased Seattle's Best in 2003 and launched a branded retail version in 2004 through its partnership with Kraft, but has done very little beyond that to develop the brand.  Seattle's Best has 550 cafés and 86 Cafe Express Coffee Bars, but represented only a 2% share of chained coffee specialist value sales in 2009 compared to nearly 90% for Starbucks, according to preliminary Euromonitor International data.  Similarly, the retail branded coffee sold US$98 million in 2009, compared to $779 million for Starbucks.  New branded outlets were most commonly opened in Borders bookstores, stemming from an agreement signed in 2005, but this chain has encountered its own problems with the rise of internet retailing and now teeters on the edge of bankruptcy in 2010.</p>
<p>Starbucks therefore announced an initiative to expand the Seattle's Best line in 2009, primarily through offering pre-packaged foodservice coffee operations to Subway and other independent operators.  At the end of 2008 the brand was in 6000 North American foodservice locations.  A year later that figure had jumped to 15,000.  A new RTD coffee line was also launched in January 2010.  Starbucks branded coffee also has a significant foodservice business to hotels and offices, but Seattle's Best will likely segment this market even further, offering a slightly cheaper alternative.</p>
<p>The new Burger King coffees, which will be priced at US$1-US$2.79, are a natural extension of this effort.  Fast food chains have seen their breakfast sales drop off with fewer people headed to work in a poor economy.  The new coffees are part of an immediate strategy to promote breakfast value deals in order to bring attention back to this daypart.  McDonald's launched a breakfast dollar menu in January 2010, and Burger King is set to follow with their own dollar menu, featuring the Seattle's Best coffee, in April.   </p>
<h2>Remaking the brand image</h2>
<p>While the addition of a branded coffee known for its quality will no doubt be beneficial to Burger King and help it to close the gap on McCafé, the move represents more of a risk to the Seattle's Best brand.   Seattle's Best to this point had positioned itself as a slightly milder blend and slightly lower in price to Starbucks, but still a premium coffee alongside any other coffee specialist chain.  Even the association with Borders appealed to a slightly more intellectual crowd of students or those interested in combining reading with their leisure time.  Burger King on the other hand cannot be construed as premium at all and does not offer the same quality of food as one might expect to see at a Seattle's Best outlet.</p>
<p>Starbucks is thus trying to create a new image for Seattle Best, one that positions the brand as an accessible level of premium quality at a more standard price.  This may appeal to the wider audience of Burger King customers but could risk alienating the core consumers that known Seattle's Best as a slightly cheaper premium coffee specialist brand.  Starbucks was placed in a similar situation when it launched its Pikes Peak Blend in 2008.  Pikes Peak was designed as a milder standard coffee blend designed to appeal to a wider audience, but it immediately angered those loyal customers who had come to appreciate the darker Starbucks roast.  </p>
<p>But faced with increased competition, Starbucks evidently feels this is a risk worth taking.  The company is acknowledging that premium cafés are not the growth engine they once were, and it is trying to create a space for itself in other cheaper segments, even launching its own Via single serve instant coffee in 2009.  Moving forward, this standard priced tier of foodservice coffee is likely to capture an ever greater proportion of coffee volume growth, and coffee manufacturers will need to find a way to be a part of it if they are not already.</p>

","<p>Specialist coffee shops in India added another year of impressive expansion in 2009, with soaring demand from young people and urban professionals fuelling 4% sales growth and double-digit outlet growth. </p>

<p>Offering a clean, quiet atmosphere for studying, socializing, or relaxing, coffee chains like Café Coffee Day and Barista have seen traffic from young, upper-income Indian consumers steadily expand, while attracting serious attention from foreign investors looking for the next emerging-market growth story. With disposable incomes continuing to rise and overall coffee shop penetration still extremely low, growth in the sector is expected to remain hot for years to come. </p>
<h2>New chains target the young and hip, as traditional cafes stagnate</h2>
<p>Coffee and café culture are by no means new to India—no-frills cafes serving coffee and simple food items for a bargain price have long existed, often serving as a meeting place for Indian politicians and intellectuals throughout the 20th century. India Coffee House, for instance, is a chain of traditional cafes operated by regional branches of the All India Coffee Workers' Cooperative Societies' Federation. The chain boasts over 300 restaurants across India, with around 50 of these in Kerala, a state in southwest India and a major coffee-growing region. Many of the chain's outlets have lost money in recent years, however, as more young people shun the often-dreary, smoky, and male-dominated traditional coffee houses in favour of more modern chains offering brighter, cleaner outlets and greater product variety. </p>
<p>Leading the charge in this regard have been two local Indian chains, Café Coffee Day and Barista, which operate over 1,200 outlets between them. Café Coffee Day, in particular, continues an ambitious expansion program, with its 800+ Café Coffee Day outlets complemented by more than 200 quick-service Coffee Day Xpress kiosks. Barista, by contrast, has consciously targeted a more upmarket demographic, with its 176 outlets aimed primarily at upper-income professionals. Both companies, meanwhile, have looked to take segmentation a step further with super-high-end “luxury” concepts offering single-estate coffees and swank interior design—Barista continues to expand its Barista Crème concept, while Café Coffee Day has countered with Coffee Day Square, which combines boutique coffees with well-appointed areas for business meetings and a selection of high-end home brewing equipment. This degree of segmentation is all the more remarkable given the relative immaturity of the modern specialist coffee shop format in India—just five years ago, the two largest chains combined for just over 200 outlets. </p>
<h3>Foreign investors make their move, while Starbucks remains on the sidelines</h3>
<p>Curiously, foreign chains remain a secondary factor in Indian coffee shops, with the largest, Whitbread plc's Costa Coffee, operating just 43 outlets as of 2009, while others, such as Segafreddo Zanetti or Caffe Ritazza operating just a handful of outlets in total. Starbucks Coffee still has no presence in India, though rumours of the chain's imminent entry appear regularly in both the Indian and international business press. Previous attempts to enter the market have fallen afoul of Indian regulatory authorities, with foreign investment in India still subject to heavy scrutiny.  This has failed to deter other investors, however, with foreign interest in the Indian coffee sector surging in recent years—Barista Coffee was purchased by Italian chain Lavazza in 2007, with Barista's outlets now rebranded as Barista Lavazza and Barista Crème Lavazza, respectively, while a private equity group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) announced a US$200 million investment in Café Coffee Day in early March. Even Starbucks is rumoured to be once again seeking a seat at the table, with recent reports suggesting a possible tie-up with Jubilant Foodworks, operator of Domino's Pizza's India outlets. What's more, Starbucks has maintained a coffee purchasing agreement with Tata Group since 2004, suggesting the American chain's engagement with India will only accelerate going forward. </p>
<h4>Today India, tomorrow the world?</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most striking fact about specialist coffee shops in India is the speed at which the category has evolved—initially serving a small core of professionals and young people, coffee chains like Café Coffee Day and Lavazza have moved quickly to capture both the emerging superpremium market as well as more value-conscious consumers, with Coffee Day Xpress kiosks now found throughout India's major urban areas. Meanwhile, Café Coffee Day continues to press forward with plans to expand internationally, now operating outlets in Austria and Pakistan, among others. The confidence shown by India's largest local chain should not serve to deter newcomers, far from it—with specialist coffee shops projected to average high single-digit sales growth over the next five years, the time to make a big splash in Indian coffee is now. Disposable incomes continue to rise, while demand for spaces to relax and socialize will only grow among India's expanding cohort of young consumers, with a dating scene only just starting to emerge in what remains a conservative country. Likewise, potential for deeper innovation in the coffee space still remains—food, in particular, offers ample room for new chains to differentiate themselves, with profits there to be had for operators able to blend traditional coffee house favourites like pastries and snacks with more Indian-influenced items. </p>

But as the effects of the global recession took hold, many Japanese consumers resorted to cutting down on nonessential purchases, and RTD coffee's premium prices left the category particularly vulnerable.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>A highly developed market with several competitors</h2>
<p>Sales of RTD coffee in Japan can be divided into three distinct categories. RTD canned coffee dominates value sales, while bulk gable/PET packs of RTD coffee are offered for home use. The third distinct category is more recently developed chilled coffee pots. In 2009, both bulk coffee and canned coffee saw sales declines due to the recession and a shorter summer. This particularly undermined sales of bulk coffee, which is largely positioned as a refreshing drink for summertime.</p>
<p>Falling sales of coffee products were not restricted to RTD coffee, meanwhile, as chained coffee shops also reported a significant fall in customer numbers through 2009. The sight of Japanese consumers carrying their own vacuum flask and cups of coffee to work became a feature of morning commuting in 2009. Indeed Yojirushi, a major supplier of vacuum flasks, reported a sales increase of over 1000% in 2009, as consumers opted to make their own coffee at home.</p>
<p>A further challenge to RTD coffee came from the development of new tonic drinks in Japan. Since the mid-2000s, tonic drinks suffered. Consumers turned away from brands such as Lipovitan and Junker owing to health concerns. RTD coffee benefited from this trend, as it was seen to offer a more natural alternative to tonic drinks. The arrival of House Foods' Ukon and Megashaki in 2008, however, attracted consumers once again to tonics.</p>
<h2>Chilled coffee gets reprieve</h2>
<p>While the recession eroded sales of canned coffee, it did not have a negative influence on sales of chilled cup coffee. This product area benefited from new product launches and widening availability via convenience stores and supermarkets/hypermarkets. Cup coffee has been available in Japan for many years, most notably with Morinaga's Mt Rainer brand, although its rapid growth phase has been a much more recent phenomenon with a great deal of new brand launch activity taking place since 2005.  Manufacturers increasingly have taken to allying themselves with chained coffee shop brands.  Starbucks Discoveries from Suntory Holdings Ltd, Doutor from Japan Tobacco Inc, and Tully's Coffee tend to be packaged in a carton cup similar to those sold via specialist coffee shops. This clearly differentiates these products from their competitors, and helps to maintain consumer interest in a product that ultimately varies little from canned coffee products such as Suntory Boss or Coca-Cola's Georgia. </p>
<h2>Zero concept transfers from carbonates</h2>
<p>Health however continued to be a key trend in RTD coffee in 2009. Nestlé continued to promote its coffee products in general as healthy based on the presence of polyphenols in coffee. There was also a steady growth in the number of low- and non-sugar brands available. “Zero” was also increasingly widely used in brand names, following on from the success of Coca-Cola Zero in carbonates. Japanese consumers find “Zero” to be easy to understand as an indication of a low calorie level in a way that previous terms linked to low-calorie products such as “Diet” and “Light” failed to achieve, and there was a rush across soft drinks to describe low calorie products as “Zero”. The launch of “Zero-rated” ham in packaged food also illustrated the effect that Coca-Cola had due across Japanese products. </p>
<p>However, while Asahi launched Wonda Zero Max in 2009, the innovator of the “Zero” term Coca-Cola did not expand this term into RTD coffee.  There is some concern among manufacturers over the use of “Zero” to describe low-calorie rather than calorie-free products. Consequently, the company that eventually launches a reasonably tasting zero-calorie RTD coffee is expected to gain share. </p>
<h2>Further growth opportunities</h2>
<p>While innovations connected to chained coffee brands and reduced calorie products were a bright spot in 2009, total RTD coffee value and volume sales are predicted to post low to moderate losses of about 1% each year overall through 2014.  This will come as Japanese consumers are slow to return to the premium priced RTD coffees that drove much of the growth since 2003.  </p>
<p>Although the market in Japan for RTD coffee is reasonably saturated and prone to competition from both hot drinks and chained coffee shops, there will still likely be opportunities for growth in at least some areas. With the right new product development, RTD coffee could still be expected to gain share from energy drinks during the forecast period. Japan has a strong tradition of coffee consumption, while the burgeoning presence of specialist coffee shops in the country is expected to further support growth in the coffee culture. In addition, RTD coffee benefits from a healthier and more premium image in comparison to energy drinks, with a widening range of unsweetened variants on offer. </p>
<h2>Communicating new benefits</h2>
<p>The continued importance of health as a marketing tool should be a key feature moving forward for new RTD coffee launches. Nestlé placed an emphasis on polyphenol content for its products in 2009, and other RTD coffee brands have also begun to reposition products along these lines.  Caffeine-free and low-caffeine RTD coffee could well be another area of strong growth, as health-conscious consumers attempt to cut back on caffeine consumption as they seek to lead a healthier lifestyle.  Many functional and health-orientated products are already present in Japan though, sometimes with quite complicated functionality. The need to simply and clearly convey benefits to consumers is therefore critical if new RTD coffees wish to raise their profile against the background of so many other brands.   Conveying a clear message will help manufacturers justify premium RTD coffee prices to an increasingly sceptical Japanese consumer.</p>

<p>Hot drinks multinationals are looking for new sources of growth from the East as coffee consumption in developed Western markets is reaching maturity. The slow sales of coffee as a result of weakened purchasing power in recession-hit established coffee markets have further encouraged coffee players to expand rapidly in Asia. Euromonitor International data shows that Asia-Pacific is set to see a net increase of US$1.4 billion rsp over 2009-2014 in instant coffee, an amount which will be equivalent to the growth of fresh coffee in Western Europe. This means that while global players are focusing their attention on expanding premium coffee pods and driving value sales in developed coffee markets, they are also advised to take a closer look at the volume and value opportunities in Asia. In this article, Euromonitor International gives a snapshot of the state of the market and highlights the further potential of the coffee mixes category.</p>
<h2>3-in-1 coffee mixes offer the most promise </h2>
<p>Coffee mixes is a highly dynamic category in Asia, with most markets seeing an ongoing array of new product launches. In Malaysia, South Korea and China coffee mixes accounted for 86%, 71% and 60%, respectively, of total instant coffee retail value sales in 2009. This means that understanding the coffee mixes category is imperative for those investors looking to enter the Asian coffee market.</p>
<p>Most major existing coffee companies offer a few coffee mix products and compete in terms of price, health and wellness attributes and packaging in order to attract consumer attention. Young consumers are the main target audience, and the whole image of the products and corresponding marketing campaigns are geared towards this audience. Given the strong growth in the youth population and continued demand for Western-style foods and beverages, coffee mixes offer a world of opportunity to multinational hot drinks companies. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International has identified that 3-in-1 mixes (sugar, powder milk and instant coffee) are currently the most popular types of coffee mixes and also offer the most potential for growth. While sophisticated Western coffee consumers are shifting towards coffee pods (fresh coffee) for reasons of convenience and waste reduction, young Asian coffee novices are experimenting with relatively mild coffee tastes. South Korea (US$422 million rsp), China (US$350 million rsp), Malaysia (US$120 million rsp) and Thailand (US$119 million rsp) are the largest 3-in-1 markets. Combined, these four markets account for over 80% of regional sales of 3-in-1 mixes, thus showing the importance of establishing a presence in these countries. Young urban consumers are fashion-conscious and price-sensitive. The right packaging and the right price may help new entrants stand out from the crowd and effectively raise brand awareness among this consumer segment. These consumers are also new media savvy, and so in-store promotions and new media communication may well be effective. </p>
<p>Japan, the world's third largest coffee market, records low sales of coffee mixes compared to its neighbouring countries. However, the ageing population and the maturity of coffee consumption have not deterred the sales growth of coffee mixes. Japan also saw the retail value sales of coffee mixes double between 2007 and 2009, albeit from a very low base.</p>

<h2>Convenience and ingredients </h2>
<p>The product design of most coffee mixes mainly serves the consumer desire for convenience. Most Asian households do not consider coffee machines as an essential domestic appliance and many Asian consumers have yet to become accustomed to coffee preparation rituals. Some young people may see the preparation process as an unnecessary hassle in their life, and so timesaving and convenient products suit their needs. Largely being price-sensitive, many of them are unwilling to pay a premium for a cup of fresh coffee or they do not yet have sophisticated enough tastes to appreciate fresh coffee. Therefore, products with a mild coffee taste and with incorporated sugar and powdered milk fit the bill nicely. When China's economy slowed over the 2008/2009 period, some office workers cut down their visits to specialist coffee shops and switched to coffee mixes, showing that keeping a low price point could help sustain volume consumption during difficult times. Starbucks, for example, reported slower than previous sales growth in China in 2009. </p>
<p>As things stand, the entry barriers to coffee mixes appear lower than those for standard instant coffee. In some cases, the powder milk and coffee beans used in mixes do not have to be of a superior quality, which may give certain coffee manufacturers some flexibility in their selection of coffee beans for cost reasons. The cost of raw materials for mixes is theoretically lower than carefully selected fine coffee beans. For example, Nespresso, the leader in coffee pods, claims that every single bean used in its pods is carefully picked and conforms to a high quality standard. In China, the average unit price of a coffee mix is around RMB80-90 per kg (rsp), while standard instant coffee is triple that price. </p>
<p>In order to reach an affordable price point, local production and getting closer to the local consumer is highly recommended. In China, Nestlé accounts for a 68% value share of the retail coffee market, with sales strongly underpinned by a steady local supply of raw materials. </p>
<h2>A few emerging trends </h2>
<p>Euromonitor International's field researchers have reported that there is no defined concept of premium coffee mixes and economy variants, so there could be an opportunity for ambitious premium hot drinks players to explore the premium end, although they will have to consider the competition from specialist cafés. Generally, the café culture is expected to continue to favour overall coffee consumption going forward. Investment in coffee mixes may well bring dividends over the long term despite the competition from cafés. Some coffee players may well use coffee mixes as an initial vehicle to enter the overall coffee market. On a challenging note, Nestlé and Kraft are the key coffee giants and their dominance of the Asian coffee market may prove costly to break through. In summary, uniqueness and differentiation will bring a competitive edge for new entrants. </p>
<p>The health and wellness trend has also filtered through into coffee mixes. Fortification and calorie reduction are the two main areas manufacturers are working on. In South Korea, manufacturers are actively introducing half-calorie instant coffee mixes. For example, Dongsuh Foods Co Ltd launched Maxim Well-Being 1/2 Calorie under the Maxim brand, which has no powder milk content, just sugar, and has half the calories of the standard product. Nestlé Korea Ltd also released Delicio1/2 Calorie with half the calories and half the caffeine, under Nescafé Taster's Choice, in 2009. A consumer switch to 2-in-1 products in fact drove down sales of 3-in-1 products in 2009.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, fortification of coffee mixes is becoming increasingly popular. Familiar (such as ginseng) and unfamiliar ingredients are being used to give products a value boost. Manufacturers are adding new ingredients and healthy attributes to established brands and are also introducing brand extensions. 5-in-1 and 6-in-1 concepts are emerging on retail shelves. Nescafé Body Partner contains soya, collagen, tongkat ali and kacip fatimah. In the Philippines, San Miguel Super Coffee Mix Co launched its San Miguel Pro-Health coffee line, which features 3-in-1 coffee fortified with nutrients designed to address specific consumer health concerns. For instance, its Pro-Beauty variant is infused with collagen, which is known to improve skin elasticity and promote beautiful skin, while its Pro-Slim contains L-carnitine, which burns fat, enabling consumers to lose weight.</p>
<p>In summary, fortification is a new way of adding value to coffee mixes. Euromonitor International believes that finding the right fortification ingredients and conveying the right marketing message to consumers will help manufacturers gain market share. However, sustaining growth and maintaining position is another challenge altogether. </p>

"Low prices, nostalgia create advantage for domestic coffee brands in Israel","While the global economic downturn has slowed overall income growth and spending in Israel, hot drinks remain popular with consumers.  Per capita purchases of hot drinks in Israel are the highest in the Middle East Africa region, at 2.7 kg/person in 2009.  This is primarily due to coffee, where Israel's 1.7kg/person trails only Algeria in the region.  A closer look at the category, however, reveals ongoing shifts in consumer preferences are driving much of the growth.","<p>While the global economic downturn has slowed overall income growth and spending in Israel, hot drinks remain popular with consumers.

This is primarily due to coffee, where Israel's 1.7kg/person trails only Algeria in the region.  A closer look at the category, however, reveals ongoing shifts in consumer preferences are driving much of the growth.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Basic products make a comeback </h2>
<p>In recent years there has been a strong tendency amongst Israeli consumers to seek products that emphasise tradition, patriotism and simplicity. This can be seen across many categories amongst all types of target audiences, from the young to more mature consumers.</p>
<p>Companies have picked up on this growing trend and have begun to use nostalgia-tinged marketing. Within packaged food for example many companies sought to profit from the 60th anniversary celebrations of the state of Israel by launching nostalgic flavours, products and packaging. Within consumer foodservice, traditional cuisines such as humus, tahini and pita bread all made comebacks as upscale, unique, yet down-to-earth cuisines.  Those products and restaurants which emphasise a return to simplicity are usually relatively inexpensive, which contributed to their success during late 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>During 2009 there was a strong tendency for consumers to return to basic and simple products within hot drinks. The financial recession was the main driving force behind this trend, as consumers sought to save money by purchasing less expensive versions of necessities.  Within coffee, consumers began to move away from instant standard coffee towards fresh ground coffee, which is considered both a more traditional and cheaper option. This led to producers, such as Strauss Group and Osem, reducing their prices and attempting to reposition their premium brands. </p>
<p> 	This move towards cheaper brands came as consumers also began to change where they shop.  In 2009, a shift was seen within retail coffee distribution in Israel, with an increased number of consumers purchasing coffee for at home consumption as they reduced their foodservice consumption. More coffee was purchased through discount channels, which tend to stock the same leading brands but at lower prices, as the effects of the recession took hold. As a result, discounters' volume share of retail coffee sales increased from 14% in 2008 to 16% in 2009. </p>
<h2>Domestic brands capitalise</h2>
<p>A growing consumer preference for traditional and cheaper brands has created a challenging environment for international brands from Nestlé, Kraft, Lavazza, and Illycafé, all of which saw flat to declining shares in retail value sales of coffee in 2009.  Local producers Strauss and Landwer were the only companies to gain value share, along with private label, thanks in part to marketing efforts made by these companies to highlight their longstanding presence in the marketplace.  </p>
<p>Strauss Group dominates retail coffee sales in Israel with a 58% share of retail value sales in 2009. The company's leading brand, Elite, which includes varieties such as Elite Turkish coffee and Elite Instant, is one of the strongest local brand names in food and drinks in Israel.  In 2009, Strauss moved some of its secondary brands under the Elite umbrella and re-launched the brand with three new instant coffee flavours: Columbian Peak, African Wild and Brazilian Rhythm. By uniting the old brands under one umbrella brand, and retaining the general look, taste and essence of the previous products, Strauss hopes to increase its sales share at a time of economic uncertainty by offering consumers a risk-free, well-established brand.  </p>
<p>Landwer Coffee, established in Germany, started manufacturing coffee in Israel in 1933 as a small coffee factory and has at times suffered from having an outdated image.  Landwer ranked a distant fourth in retail coffee value sales with a share under 2% for much of the early part of the 2000s. Landwer does have a long-established brand name, however. Following a release with new branding and packaging, the company has seen steady coffee sales and share gains throughout the recent recession years, up to 4% of retail value in 2009, as its traditional styling and flavour is once again seen as an asset by consumers.</p>
<h2>Driving traffic to stores will be key to future growth</h2>
<p>The frugal consumer mentality helping to popularize cheaper, traditional brands is likely to remain a key component of coffee purchasing in the short term, but eventually consumers will have more money to spend and will begin to gravitate back towards more premium coffees.  At this point, brands will need to take steps to catch the attention of consumers switching back from discount outlets.  Once again, domestic coffee producers have already taken the lead in this regard with innovative new retail concepts. </p>
<p>During 2009 Strauss Group invested NIS5 million in the launch of “Turkey in the City”, a new concept pop-up store located in a popular, centrally located mall that sells only Elite Turkish coffee, which accounted for a 79% share of fresh ground coffee retail value sales in 2009. The idea behind the launch was to emphasise the experience that lies behind the brand as Elite Turkish coffee has become part of Israeli culture and attracted a large and loyal audience. </p>
<p>Landwer Coffee has sold its brand name rights to franchisees, which currently operate four coffee shops, three in the Tel Aviv area and one in the north of Israel. The newest Tel Aviv outlet was launched in January 2009 as a “children friendly” outlet with a designated environment suited to children's activities within a coffee shop location.  These kinds of unique concepts help these brands more directly control how they engage their consumers at the point of sale and create a value added component to distinguish themselves from competitors.  This will create a positive association with the brand that has the potential to last long beyond the current trend towards retro products.     </p>
<p>Domestic producers like Strauss and Landwer may be benefiting from a recent consumer shift towards cheaper brands, but they are also taking steps to build a new credibility behind their labels that will linger in the minds of consumers, now that they have the spotlight.  It is not certain that consumers will move once again to premium or foreign coffees, if domestic brands continue to offer unique added value propositions.  As Israelis begin to see their economic situation improve, they will look beyond just price and ask themselves once again what the coffees they see on the shelf have to offer.  Manufacturers will need to project a clear answer if they hope to counter the encroachment of traditional domestic brands.      </p>

Coffee-to-go adds a new twist to Germany’s coffee culture,"Germans are passionate coffee drinkers, with their annual per capita coffee consumption of an estimated 147 litres in 2010 ranking among Europe's highest. Yet this mature market continues to evolve, with more consumers demanding on-the-go convenience.","<p>Germans are passionate coffee drinkers, with their annual per capita coffee consumption of an estimated 147 litres in 2010 ranking among Europe's highest. Yet this mature market continues to evolve, with more consumers demanding on-the-go convenience.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Traditionally, coffee houses and home-brewed coffee have been the standard methods for Germans to get their daily caffeine fix. For decades Germans were satisfied with filter coffee until a new craving for more sophisticated, Italian-style coffee creations emerged during the late 1990s. The new trend was fuelled by the sudden emergence of self-service coffee outlets such as Segafredo and Lavazza, which aimed to please Germany's coffee taste buds with hitherto unheard-of creations such as Latte Macchiato. On top of growing demands for quality, however, has come real demand for convenience, with the country's 1,100 chained coffee shops and 300 independent outlets serving increasingly mobile, time-starved consumers. This, in turn, has fuelled increasingly cutthroat competition between both multinationals like McDonald's and local innovators. </p>
<h2>Multinationals on a steep growth path with coffee on the go</h2>
<p>McDonald's long ago realised the potential of trendy coffee-to-go in Germany and introduced its McCafé shop-in-shop format to the German market as early as 2003. In 2009, the fast food giant counted over 600 outlets and continues to expand in both outlet numbers and transaction figures. What makes the McCafé range of coffee specialities appealing to German customers is not only the value for money aspect but also the fact that the coffee is Rainforest Alliance certified – a perk which is highly appreciated by German consumers who have long shown that they are keen on going green. Burger King, as well jumped on the coffee bandwagon in 2009 when it opened its first Burger King outlet with an integrated coffee bar, a concept which is run in collaboration with the Munich-based franchise brand San Francisco Coffee Company (SFCC). As a franchisee of SFCC, Burger King is looking to introduce the coffee bars into Burger King outlets nationwide if the format proves successful during 2010. </p>
<p>As it has elsewhere, coffee has become a key growth driver for Germany's leading fast food chains, offering high margins and the potential for brisk expansion through an existing outlet base. With around 2,000 outlets between them, both McDonald's and Burger King have a long potential runway for growth, while possessing the capability to put high-end coffee even in relatively small towns and localities where competition is limited. </p>
<h3>Home-grown coffee shops keeping pace</h3>
<p>While global chains are expanding at a brisk pace, competition remains strong from smaller local chains, many of whom have succeeded by targeting a more niche audience. Another One such success story is Hamburg-based Balzac Coffee, established in 1998 by an ambitious entrepreneur, Vanessa Kullmann, who had come across the coffee-to-go concept during a visit to the US in the 1990s. Within five years, Kullmann managed to establish the domestic chain as a trend-setting, well-known and popular spot for indulgent coffee specialities in Northern Germany. By the end of 2009, Balzac counted over 40 outlets, mainly in Hamburg and Berlin, where customers queue for exotic treats such as Chai Laccinos. Since the mid-2000s the format has been frequently awarded with such titles as 'entrepreneur of the year' among others.</p>
<p>Taking a more daring approach is Cahoona Coffee – a coffee drive-in situated in the heart of Berlin, close to the German Ministry of Finance. With an average of 42,000 cars passing by at a slow pace every day, the location of Cahoona was wisely chosen. Up to six cars can pull over at the same time, and Cahoona guarantees a 60-second service. In its first year of operation, the outlet counted around 100-150 clients per day, 70% of which were returning customers. Along with the strictly drive-through positioning, the new shop offers a Hawaiian theme, with Hawaiian-shirt-clad baristas offering a cheery “aloha” to customers. </p>
<h4>Where next for coffee shops</h4>
<p>Coffee shops are here to stay in Germany and new concepts such as Cahoona are testimony to the potential that this format continues to offer, as well as a glimpse of how the sector might evolve over the next five years. After coffee bars successfully conquered motorway service stations in 2007/2008, the coffee drive-in provides a new level of convenience that is likely to attract loyal followers and become more widely available across Germany. In anticipation of this, Cahoona owner Gunter Wakulat is already planning the franchise of 10 further Cahoona outlets in Berlin over the next three years. </p>
<p>While convenience will remain an important demand driver, a number of other trends continue to gain steam. New flavour creations will keep customers interested in trying out indulgent varieties, but there is also likely to be greater interest in sustainable options in the future, especially organic and fairtrade – two subjects about which Germans are increasingly concerned. Growing health awareness might also drive demand for lighter options containing skimmed milk or less sugar. Soy milk is likely to become a more popular milk alternative as even in Germany, a country with a low incidence of lactose intolerance, awareness of this condition is rising. </p>

Sara Lee makes bold move with new European coffee pod,"In April 2010 Sara Lee Corp launched L'Or branded coffee pod capsules in France for use on Nestlé SA's Nespresso machines, the first competitor to offer pods on what had been a proprietary system.  Nestlé owns 1700 patents on the Nespresso system design and has vowed to challenge the new products if they find patent infringement, so Sara Lee is taking a great risk that such legal measures will not be successful in stopping the sale of their products.  ","<p>In April 2010 Sara Lee Corp launched L'Or branded coffee pod capsules in France for use on Nestlé SA's Nespresso machines, the first competitor to offer pods on what had been a proprietary system.  Nestlé owns 1700 patents on the Nespresso system design and has vowed to challenge the new products if they find patent infringement, so Sara Lee is taking a great risk that such legal measures will not be successful in stopping the sale of their products.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>But for Sara Lee, a company highly dependent on its European coffee business since the sale of its North American coffee brands to Segafredo Zanetti in 2006, it is a gamble worth taking.  L'Or pods will be priced 10-20% less than Nespresso pods and the company is hoping that consumers will respond to a less premium priced offering, especially one available through supermarkets and mass outlets.  Nespresso capsules are typically shipped directly to the consumer or purchased in its branded stores.</p>
<h2>Western Europe pod market shows potential</h2>
<p>Nespresso has built success throughout Western Europe in part through its reputation for quality and has also gained a cachet through sleek design.  Nespresso machines are shiny with chrome trim, and its boutiques are often found in trendy cosmopolitan areas, offering consumers perks like free espressos.  Nespresso is the leading brand of all fresh ground coffee by value sales in both France and Switzerland, with more than half the market in 2009 in the latter, all while not being sold through traditional grocery retail.</p>
<p>Coffee pods themselves are one of the fastest growing segments of hot drinks, comprising more than 20% of ground coffee value sales in Belgium and Germany, and more than 40% in France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands in 2009, according to Euromonitor International figures.  More importantly, coffee pods are projected to grow by more than US$1.2 billion in Western Europe by 2014, in constant 2009 dollars, contributing the majority of expected growth in fresh ground coffee sales for that period.</p>
<p>Nestlé is the overall leader in Western European coffee sales with a 19% value share in 2009, but stands to see some of that lead erode with this new competition for Nespresso.  Sara Lee stood in third place behind Kraft with 10% of value sales in 2009 through its Senseo, Douwe Egberts, and L'Or brands, typically priced much cheaper than Nespresso.  At 30 euro cents, the new L'Or capsules will be a significant step up from 10 euro cents Senseo pods, but still cheaper than existing Nespresso offerings.  Sara Lee has slowly gained nearly a full point of market share since 2004, and this new launch should help to further that trend by appealing to consumers looking for cheaper options, especially those who might have cut back on spending during the recent global downturn.</p>
<h2>Nespresso: an open platform?</h2>
<p>Perhaps even more worrisome for Nestlé is the possibility that Sara Lee's move will be replicated by others.  Already another competing pod is set to be launched in May from Ethical Coffee Co., a company organised by a former CEO of Nespresso. Ethical Coffee plans to launch its capsules in Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, and Austria in 2010 and 2011.  Initial orders from retailers reached 4 billion units.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a demand for these new, lower priced versions of Nespresso pods.  Nestlé is no doubt hoping that its higher level of quality will still justify its higher prices in the eyes of consumers.  Indeed, Nestlé offers more than 15 flavours of Nespresso, often with exclusive coffees from places like Tanzania and Peru.   Ethical Coffee and even a large producer like Sara Lee will find difficulty matching the breadth and quality of these offerings without added production capacity and investment.   </p>
<p>Consumers lured by lower prices may eventually return to original Nespresso pods to find the same level of quality, but it is unlikely that all of them will have this reaction.  Nestlé was able to clearly separate itself from lower priced competitors when Nespresso was a distinct brewing system.  This will be much more difficult to maintain now that consumers can directly compare coffees brewed through the same process.  While the lead they have built is likely safe in the short term, Nestlé will likely need to take new steps to meet this threat, through more exclusive offerings, expansion into supermarkets, or legal options to defend their patents if possible.  In the meantime, a strong growth opportunity has just opened up for pod competitors in the world's most developed coffee pod region.   </p>

Green Mountain solidifies K-Cup control with Diedrich Coffee purchase,"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) finally closed their US$290 million purchase of Diedrich Coffee Inc in May 2010 after a long review by the US Federal Trade Commission.  The companies agreed to merge in November 2009, coming to terms after several rounds of bidding against rival Peet's Coffee and Tea Inc.  Diedrich is one of the principal licensees manufacturing K-Cup single serve coffee pods for use on the Keurig system.  Keurig and its associated patents are in turn owned by GMCR.  ","<p>Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) finally closed their US$290 million purchase of Diedrich Coffee Inc in May 2010 after a long review by the US Federal Trade Commission.  The companies agreed to merge in November 2009, coming to terms after several rounds of bidding against rival Peet's Coffee and Tea Inc.  Diedrich is one of the principal licensees manufacturing K-Cup single serve coffee pods for use on the Keurig system.  Keurig and its associated patents are in turn owned by GMCR.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Diedrich was the subject of takeover rumours for many months, especially after an early 2009 deal the company made to divest most of its Gloria Jean coffee shops and real estate, reducing its overhead and allowing it to focus more exclusively on K-Cup production.  This move made Diedrich a much more attractive asset, leading to a large bid despite its shares trading as low as 31 cents in March 2009 and having only US$62 million in revenues in FY2009.</p>
<h2>Entry into fast growing pods segment attracts suitors</h2>
<p>Single serve coffee pods represented less than 2% of the overall coffee market in the US in 2009, according to Euromonitor International figures.  However, coffee pods have seen strong growth over the last few years, and are expected to enjoy more than 30% retail volume growth through 2014, far outpacing fresh coffee and the stagnant instant coffee market. Coffee pods have also found even greater success with office sales in the US, which are excluded from Euromonitor International data.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">US coffee forecast volume growth</h4>
<p>2009-2014<img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\47a80285-5fc7-4aa3-a7bd-fcef18782821.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<p>Single serve coffee pods saw a wave of product launches in the early 2000s from major manufacturers like Kraft, Sara Lee, and Nestlé, but the clear leader in the US by 2009 was GMCR with its Keurig K-Cups.  According to company sources, Diedrich K-Cups were the top selling food item on Amazon.com in 2009.  After operating for many years under its licensing model, GMCR began to buy up its major licensees in 2009, starting with Tully's Coffee Corp in March of that year and Timothy's Coffees of the World Inc in November.  By November, this left Diedrich as one of the only remaining independent K-Cup licensees and a crucial chip in GMCR's emerging plan to bring all K-Cup production in house, as well as an attractive way for outside manufacturers to gain immediate scale in production of the leading coffee pod brand. </p>
<h2>Bidding war proves too much for Peet's</h2>
<p>On November 2, Diedrich initially agreed to be purchased by Peet's Coffee and Tea Inc, a California-based coffee manufacturer.  Peet's has around 200 coffee shop locations in California and across the country, but it also has existing distribution deals with national grocery retailers like Safeway and Whole Foods.  Though competing pods under the Tassimo and Senseo brands are widely distributed in supermarkets, sales of K-Cups have been limited to specialty retailers like Bed, Bath and Beyond, Wal-Mart, Target, and other mass merchandisers, club stores, internet, and direct sales.  Peet's hoped to leverage its distribution chain to make the first major push for K-Cups into supermarkets.</p>
<p>Peet's initial offer was a combined cash and stock agreement at US$26/share.  GMCR countered in late November with an all cash bid, setting off a series of counteroffers that ended in December with GMCR victorious at US$35/share.  Peet's at this point began to argue that there were anti-trust issues with the higher GMCR bid, as Diedrich would give them over 80% control of K-Cup production and more than half of the US coffee pod market.  Indeed, the FTC took five months to review the deal, but ultimately concluded that coffee pods did not constitute a separate market and there was far greater competition in the context of overall US coffee sales. </p>
<h2>High price points to larger objectives</h2>
<p>For GMCR, the inflated price paid for Diedrich does not reflect so much the immediate earning power of the business as much as its strategic importance to GMCR's evolving business model.  First, Diedrich Coffee has a manufacturing facility in California, while GMCR is based in Vermont.  In addition to providing most of the K-Cup production for the West Coast, this facility along with Tully's should provide the groundwork for greater expansion of the Green Mountain K-Cup brand beyond its East Coast roots.  Timothy's achieves a similar objective for Canadian sales of K-Cups.  GMCR will thus be able to move from a regional brand strategy to a more flexible national manufacturing capacity, allowing for previously licensed brands to grow in new North American metropolitan areas. </p>
<p>Setting up this flexibility now is of particular importance to GMCR, as its patents on the Keurig K-Cup design expire in 2012.  This will allow third party competitors to make pods for the Keurig single serve system.  Nestlé recently experienced this when Sara Lee launched a competing pod in France for its Nespresso system, at a price 20-30% cheaper than existing Nespresso pods.  Since most major US coffee players have their own proprietary pods, a competing K-Cup launch is unlikely in the short term.  Such a launch would more likely come from a smaller, more regional manufacturer.  If this happens, GMCR now has a geographical advantage of scale that a newer, cheaper pod manufacturer could not immediately match.</p>
<h2>A move across the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>Part of GMCR's longer term production strategy could be a move into Western European markets.  Coffee pods are far more successful in this part of the world, especially for use in brewing at home.  Coffee pods represented more than 70% of fresh ground coffee sales in Switzerland in 2009 for instance, and more than 20% in France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.  Production or importing of K-Cups to these countries would be a costly endeavour, but global competitors like Kraft and Sara Lee have already found success with their coffee pod systems in the region.  Ultimately, GMCR will likely find that there is a limit to how much consumer penetration can be gained in North America, and Western European markets will become the primary option for further coffee pod growth.  The scale they have achieved over the last 12 months will help GMCR be in a better position to make this move. </p>

"Coffee shops fill vital, growing niche in Middle East","While coffee shops are now a worldwide growth phenomenon, they have proven especially popular in the Middle East, where they have become an important, and growing part of both the foodservice landscape and social life in general. ","<p>While coffee shops are now a worldwide growth phenomenon, they have proven especially popular in the Middle East, where they have become an important, and growing part of both the foodservice landscape and social life in general. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>To some degree, this is nothing new; coffee has been consumed in the Middle East for centuries, and thriving coffeehouse cultures have long existed in the region. Yet there is no question that the modern coffee shop sector represents something new, providing a social outlet for women, students, and other young people in stark contrast to the male-dominated traditional café sector. Particularly in more-conservative markets like Saudi Arabia, where alcoholic drinks are banned and social opportunities of any kind are limited, coffee shops have emerged as a major nighttime gathering place. Far from a morning ritual, in much of the Middle East coffee drinking is done at night, with scorching daytime temperatures pushing eating out well into the evening. For international coffee chains, the growing importance of coffee shops to young people in the Middle East is a major opportunity, yet one which will require real adjustment to be fully realized. </p>
<h2>Demand surges across the region</h2>
<p>The expansion of the coffee sector in the Middle East is truly a region-wide phenomenon—Egypt and Saudi Arabia alone accounted for around US$120 million in spending through modern coffee shops in 2009, while markets like Lebanon, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are all witnessing booming expansion. Overall coffee consumption has moved steadily upwards as well—since 2004, volume sales of fresh coffee have grown by 20% in Egypt, more than 30% in Morocco and Saudi Arabia, and a remarkable 85% in the United Arab Emirates, indicating strong demand for both at-home and on-the-go coffee drinking opportunities. </p>
<p>Surging coffee demand has not gone unnoticed by the world's largest chains—Starbucks now has close to 300 outlets in the Middle East, while Whitbread plc's Costa Coffee brand operates more than 150 stores, nearly half of which can be found in the UAE. Canada's Second Cup chain also has a strong presence, joined by smaller players like Tully's and Caribou Coffee, a primarily US-based chain controlled by a division of Bahrain-based Arcapita Bank. At the same time, however, multiple local chains continue to hold their own—Egypt's Cilantro, for instance, now operates 56 branches there, more than Starbucks and Costa combined, while in Saudi Arabia a number of local operates enjoy a brisk business. Dr. Café, for instance, has built a strong presence with a heavy emphasis on hospitals, universities, and other non-traditional locations. Such fierce competition has helped fuel an accelerating process of segmentation, as chains look to differentiate their offerings—Cilantro, for instance, has moved aggressively towards the high end, investing heavily in distinctive outlet design and promoting a leisurely, relaxed atmosphere. </p>
<h3>A growing social magnet</h3>
<p>One of the key drivers behind this expansion is a soaring youth population—students and young people are a key demographic for coffee chains the world over, and many of the Middle East's most important markets boast very young populations indeed. The median age in the countries of the GCC is just 26, while in Egypt it is 24 and in Jordan 22, indicating a large cohort of young people looking for places to socialize and eager to try new international brands—Egypt alone is home to over 45 million consumers under the age of 30, while Saudi Arabia boasts more than 15 million under-30 consumers, according to Euromonitor. The social value of new, modern coffee shops should not be underestimated—many traditional cafes in the region, such as Egypt's ahwas, tend to serve an older, overwhelmingly male clientele, and outlets tend to be rather austere, leaving space for chains looking to serve a more mixed group of consumers seeking a more modern, upmarket atmosphere.</p>
<p>More broadly, coffee houses occupy, along with foodservice in general, a very important position in terms of entertainment and social life in the Middle East. While one must not overgeneralise, on the whole social and entertainment options in the region tend to be somewhat limited compared with, say, Western Europe or North America. Saudi Arabia represents the most extreme example of this, with alcohol totally illegal and many other social activities either strictly regulated or banned outright, yet conservatism remains the rule throughout much of the region, though exceptions do exist—Lebanon, in particular, boasts a thriving nightlife in and around Beirut. On the whole, this means that eating out (along with other activities like shopping) is a major, major social activity—in markets like Kuwait, it is coffee shops and other foodservice outlets that see brisk business on weekends and at night, serving a function similar to bars, taverns, and other nightspots in other markets. </p>
<h4>Adaptation, collaboration are key</h4>
<p>For coffee shop operators, this means that while demand is strong and growing, it is often for a slightly different product and experience than has proven successful elsewhere. The morning rush is limited as a daypart opportunity (even doughnut shops tend to see most of their traffic in the evening), while lunchtime is often spent at home, with businesses often shutting down during the midday heat, particularly in the desert states of the Gulf. Rather than fast, in-and-out service, an emphasis on atmosphere and quality is key, with many guests looking to linger and socialize. Operators should be prepared to adapt their existing models with an eye on the current incumbents—as noted, Cilantro has carved out a strong presence in Egypt by emphasizing outlet design, with an in-house design teams allowed considerable leeway in tailoring individual outlets to specific areas and consumer groups. </p>
<p>In addition, finding the right local partner is as vital for coffee shop operators as it is for any other foodservice brand looking to make a splash in the Middle East. Besides offering valuable experience navigating a complicated cultural and business environment, scale is important given the powerful brands already present in the region. What's more, with so much of the region's foodservice found in shopping centres and other air-conditioned indoor facilities, combining with a partner able to negotiate with local property magnates (or with significant real estate holdings of its own) is vital—around a quarter of Saudi Arabia's 2009 foodservice sales, for instance, came through retail locations, with shopping centres accounting for a large portion of this total. </p>

Changing consumption habits create space for new coffee sales in Poland,"Polish consumers drink coffee at a rate more than twice that of tea, built upon a long tradition of serving coffee at social gatherings and a more recent café culture.  Retail volume sales of coffee in Poland reached 110,000 tonnes in 2009, good enough for sixth in the world.

At 3 kg per capita, Polish coffee consumpti","<p>Polish consumers drink coffee at a rate more than twice that of tea, built upon a long tradition of serving coffee at social gatherings and a more recent café culture.  Retail volume sales of coffee in Poland reached 110,000 tonnes in 2009, good enough for sixth in the world.  The figure actually outranks Russia as the largest Eastern European market for retail coffee, though Russia takes the lead once again when foodservice coffee sales are added in.  At 3 kg per capita, Polish coffee consumption already rivals much of Western Europe and might appear to have little further room for growth.  But a shift in how consumers purchase and use coffee is also underway in Poland, creating new opportunities for manufacturers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Modernising the coffee culture</h2>
<p>For many decades, coffee in Poland was consumed without the use of machines, by mixing ground coffee with a large portion of hot water. After emergence from communist rule, cafés became more popular as they increasingly began to offer espresso-style coffees.  Today this trend continues, as cafés and coffee specialist outlets remain popular places for young people to gather, or for business professionals to hold meetings.  </p>
<p>Economic growth during 2006-2009 led to greater consumer spending power, and coffee machines increasingly appeared in offices and households. As coffee machines have become more adopted by consumers, sales of fresh ground coffee such as espresso, fresh coffee beans and also coffee pods have also increased. The greatest sales growth came from coffee beans, which is due to the widely held belief that fresh ground beans are better quality.</p>
<p>With more and more Poles now owning coffee machines, there has been a gradual move towards higher quality fresh coffee. Coffee aficionados seek new tastes, and seek out coffee varieties rarely available in traditional outlets. Sales through internet coffee retailers and specialist coffee shops located in big cities have been increasing, due to growing demand for exclusive coffee varieties. </p>
<h2>Premium demand developing</h2>
<p>While in 2009 the economic slowdown and rising unemployment led to demand for cheaper coffee, at the other end of the spectrum, high income consumers in secure, well paid jobs helped sustain demand for premium products.  This two tiered pricing structure has also not benefited private label coffees, unlike other markets where recent trading down has led to private label share gains. </p>
<p>The level of coffee culture has progressed to the point where Polish consumers' high expectations in terms of taste or aroma are not able to be fulfilled by private label. Additionally, coffee sales are dominated by well known brands, which is significant as consumers recognise quality as being the domain of branded products.  Private label coffees held less than 2% of Polish coffee value sales in 2009, and have limited growth opportunities. Consumers will instead be inclined to limit their daily consumption of branded products rather than switch from quality products to those of lesser quality.</p>
<h2>Multinationals bring premium quality, innovation</h2>
<p>The major companies in the category such as Kraft Foods, Nestlé, Tchibo, Strauss Cafe, and Prima-Sara Lee Coffee and Tea are all foreign owned. National players such as Woseba Sp zoo, PPK Astra Sp zoo, Sido Sidorek Wroblewski Spj and Mokate SA have much weaker positions on the market and tend to follow prevailing market trends, with some introducing coffee pods (Astra, Celmar), 2-in-1coffee mixes (Sido, Mokate) or coffee with reduced amount of caffeine (Mokate, Astra) to their product lines.</p>
<p>But it is multinationals that garner the greatest attention with high profile premium brand launches.  New brand Douwe Egberts was launched from Sara Lee Coffee and Tea in 2009. At the beginning of 2009, Kraft Foods launched the Carte Noire brand. This brand, like Douwe Egberts, has a high unit price and targets affluent customers, who value the high quality of fresh coffee beans. </p>
<p>The packaging of the fresh coffee Douwe Egberts brand is also innovative, as it is packed in folding cartons, in contrast to other brands. This packaging, named CLICKPAQ, allows the pack to be opened and resealed with a completely airtight closure. This kind of closure has not been used by any other manufacturer of fresh coffee in Poland so far. Carte Noire in turn is packed in 250g flexible aluminium/plastic standing brick cartons. The package is equipped with a tiny valve which emits the coffee's aroma, another innovation unmatched by any other fresh ground brand.</p>
<h2>Opportunity for distinctive brands to stand out</h2>
<p>Manufacturers will face rising expectations in regards to the quality of the coffee they produce. Demanding Polish customers will not be willing to purchase products in attractive packaging if quality of the contents is not adequate. Therefore, concern about the quality of products should become a priority, especially for manufacturers of standard and premium brands. During the next five years there will be growing polarization between price sensitive customers and those who are more interested in product quality. </p>
<p>This will lead to further intensified competition among manufacturers who will have to work harder to gain consumer acceptance.  But this could also lead to a new opportunity for innovative brands offering added value.  One example of this is with coffee pods. As the availability of coffee machines in households, offices and other work places grows, new habits of coffee consumption will be created.  Traditionally prepared coffee will lose consumers to coffee prepared by coffee machine. Coffee pods are easy to use because they do not require each portion to be measured (each packet has the same quantity). Thus people who are not afraid of novelty and seek innovative, easy-to-use products will be inclined to purchase coffee pod machines.  Nestlé's Nescafé Dolce Gusto pod brand was promoted heavily in 2009, and other pods could quickly follow suit.  As consumers develop more of a taste for higher quality, convenient coffees and leave the traditional brewing methods behind, unique brands like this stand to benefit, both in Poland and across Eastern Europe. </p>

Can RTD coffee reverse its recent global slowdown?,"RTD coffee remains a highly specialised product that has only gained momentum in a handful of global markets, and this lack of geographical diversity took its toll in 2009.  After several years of strong sales, world RTD coffee volume sales growth was flat in 2009, and value sales were up 6%, but this was less than half the growth seen a year earlier. ","<p>RTD coffee remains a highly specialised product that has only gained momentum in a handful of global markets, and this lack of geographical diversity took its toll in 2009.  After several years of strong sales, world RTD coffee volume sales growth was flat in 2009, and value sales were up 6%, but this was less than half the growth seen a year earlier. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p> Japan represents nearly 80% of all world RTD coffee sales and saw sales declines for the first time in 2009, dragging down the overall world performance.  The US similarly saw value and volume sales declines for the first time in 2009, along with the market exits of several second tier brands.  As a premium priced, indulgent drink with distribution primarily in developed markets, RTD coffee was particularly vulnerable to the consumer shift in spending that occurred during the recent economic downturn.  Manufacturers must now ask themselves what can be done to once again find growth in the category.</p>
<h2>Price and distribution are limiting factors in mature markets</h2>
<p>In mature markets like the US, RTD coffee is seen as more of an expensive treat than an everyday purchase, and sales are predicted to continue to struggle as consumers are slow to return to indulgent spending.  The market leader Frappuccino from Starbucks also has a large advantage in distribution from its first mover status, and new entries often struggle to gain entry into national chained stores.  As a result, brands for the most part have not been able to take advantage of the current environment of frugality to compete on price.  Some private label exists, but the high costs of production continue to limit the options for this kind of launch on a national level.</p>
<p>The story is similar in other markets.  In Norway, Tine BA has built sales of RTD coffee since 1999, and has been able to control all movements in the category. Jensen & Co (Emmi brand) and Nestlé Norge AS with Nescafé Iskaffe have tried to compete but without significant success.  In part this is because the unit price of these brands was higher than Tine upon launch, and consumers were wary of switching to more unknown brands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, premium pricing seems to be a common and deliberate strategy for RTD coffee launches around the world.  In China, Starbucks launched an RTD coffee priced at around RMB13 per 281ml bottle, more than double the price of a typical carbonate.  Even during the recent economic downturn, RTD coffee manufacturers seldom relied on discounting and promotion to spur sales of RTD coffee in 2009. On the contrary, new products were generally priced at a high level to set a premium brand image.</p>
<h2>Brands begin to target women </h2>
<p>Despite these challenges, RTD coffee manufacturers have already fared better than global figures may seem to indicate.  Once Japan is removed, the rest of the world saw a 3% volume sales increase in 2009, roughly the same as a year earlier.  Manufacturers continue to find success through focusing on expansion to new consumer segments, rather than increasing frequency of purchasing in the midst of economic headwinds.  </p>
<p>Several countries feature RTD coffees that expressly target women, playing upon the indulgence element of the drinks.  Dairy content is highlighted as a healthier element and contrasted with hot drinks.  Dutch consumers of RTD coffees, for example, are predominantly women who do not want the caffeine intake found in brewed coffee and drink iced RTD coffee drinks as a substitute.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the look of RTD coffee packaging is influencing purchases among younger women.  The trend of female consumers being very sensitive to fashion continued to affect beverage packaging. The most effective strategy is creating a stylish and trendy image for brands and packaging is changing to satisfy the demand of these fastidious consumers. The packaging of RTD coffee became smaller in recent years so that female consumers can easily carry these products. The shapes became slimmer to help convey the notion of lower calorie versions being slimming, which is now an important marketing point for brands. </p>
<h2>Attention to packaging can create more opportunities</h2>
<p>While RTD coffees vary in shape and size, from glass bottles to plastic packaging, attention to detail is another way some RTD coffee brands have been able to distinguish themselves.  In Norway, Tine's metal design stands out on the shelves and received the Norwegian Design Association award for best design in the grocery channel.  But Tine also highlights the fact that all the coffee used to produce its RTD coffee comes from Brazil, which is known for the good quality of its coffee beans.  Also, the company sells its RTD coffee in carton packaging, which is more appealing to Norwegians, who are used to most dairy products being sold in cartons, in particular milk, as well as fruit/vegetable juice.</p>
<p>Probably the most influential trend in packaging currently is the emergence of multipacks. Much like innovations seen with energy drinks and RTD teas, the introduction of multipacks, typically containing four RTD coffees, has helped make these products more attractive to supermarkets, hypermarkets and mass merchants – outlets with more shelf space than a traditional convenience store or coffee specialist – and helped to hasten the expansion of RTD coffee brands into these outlets.  Multipacks encourage higher volume purchasing for home use, rather than the impulse purchasing that is more common in convenience stores.</p>
<p>Even as most economies continue to recover in 2010, RTD coffee's premium image means that it is unlikely to return to the high growth seen in the years prior to 2008.  RTD coffee manufacturers' greatest challenge will be to overcome their reliance on Japan and a few other major markets for the majority of their sales.  If there is to be future growth in the category, it will likely come from building new sales through carving out new usage occasions and targeting new consumer segments in the dozens of smaller markets throughout regions like Western Europe and Asia-Pacific, rather than relying on momentum of large brands in Japan and the US.  </p>

Costa Coffee unveils new outlet designs to drive London sales,"With an eye towards boosting traffic from city workers, Costa Coffee is set to roll out its new “Metropolitan” outlet design in London this week, combining cutting-edge design with an emphasis on service speed. ","<p>With an eye towards boosting traffic from city workers, Costa Coffee is set to roll out its new “Metropolitan” outlet design in London this week, combining cutting-edge design with an emphasis on service speed. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>While quick-service operators of all types have been investing in improved outlet design for some time now, Costa's latest effort offers a glimpse at how this trend could continue to evolve, with individual outlets increasingly customised to specific locations and consumer groups. The plethora of options available in global cities like London and New York is a major catalyst, too, as global chains look to maximise their return on investments in pricey high street locations. </p>
<h2>Sleek and fast vs. warm and relaxing</h2>
<p>The new Costa Coffee outlets are strongly geared towards morning commuters, with an emphasis on speed and hot breakfast. Artist renderings of the new stores suggest a relatively austere design, with heavy use of stark lighting, exposed brick and glass, and a dedicated bar area, underlining the focus on quick, in-and-out service for customers on their way to work. The new concept is a modernist departure from standard Costa outlets, which tend to be far more conducive to lingering and socialising, yet this is likely precisely the point; the aim of the new outlets is to drive breakfast sales and morning traffic, when speed is absolutely crucial, while demand for comfort is far more muted. </p>
<p>The new outlets represent the latest chapter in an ongoing struggle for differentiation among the UK's leading coffee shop chains, with outlet design now a key element of branding—in contrast to Costa's sleek new Metropolitan concept, Starbucks opened its first UK “heritage” concept on Conduit Street in London last year, with a mix of muted colours, big comfortable chairs, and heavy use of wood and antiques designed to create a relaxing yet upscale experience. Much like the company's neighbourhood concepts in Seattle, the new store design looks to evoke the feel of a unique local coffee shop, with Starbucks branding often taking a back seat to other design cues—in effect, the outlet has become the brand. While Starbucks' approach has so far differed a great deal from Costa's in terms of focus, the ultimate aim is the same—instead of the rigorous standardisation that has long defined chained foodservice, the goal for both chains now is to create a unique, local experience, one tailored not simply to a given market, but to specific day parts, cities, and even neighbourhoods. </p>

<p>The importance of outlet design and quality to branding is only expected to grow going forward—with chains of all types now looking to present a higher-quality (and higher-priced) menu selection, outlet quality has become an increasingly key element of any operators branding message. This is particularly true in specialist coffee shops, where operators increasingly face fierce competition on the low end from fast food chains and others, forcing chains like Costa and Starbucks to double down on messages of quality and experience. More broadly, a combination of saturated markets and recession-minded consumers has forced operators to fight for every last customer in an effort to keep traffic growing. </p>
<p>All of this adds up to an environment where chains must think long and hard about what their outlets are accomplishing. While high-end design and expensive furnishings are often part of the equation, the current trend is not simply about premiumisation, but rather about customisation—Costa's Metropolitan concept is undoubtedly upscale, but more importantly it is targeted towards a specific consumer group and a specific day part, with every design element going to support these efforts. In this way the concept is not unlike McDonald's long-running use of kiosks to reach low-income neighbourhoods in Brazil, a case of tweaking the concept and using the outlet as part of a strategy to reach a local market. </p>
<p>What's more, consumers in developed markets increasingly demand this type of unique, tailored experience, whether through packaged items, retail, or foodservice—seemingly every brand now has a story, and particularly in major cities high street stores often go to great lengths to maintain the look and feel of a specific neighbourhood or building. While consistency of product and service are still absolutely vital, particularly in foodservice, there is real demand for a chain that can offer a true range of experiences. Needless to say this strategy is risky, potentially diluting the brand and confusing consumers, yet the potential rewards are considerable—Costa can now serve as a credible option throughout the day, with city locations offering fast, in-and-out service, while other outlets can reach consumers looking to linger. </p>

Thailand coffee manufacturers succeed through product innovations,"Thailand represented one of the most dynamic growth markets for coffee in 2009, despite the lingering effects of a global economic downturn.  Coffee total volume sales grew 13% during the year, leading all Asia-Pacific countries, largely on gains made from instant standard coffee. Instant standard coffee has registered the strongest growth since 2005 due to its lower price point and several other competitive advantages it enjoys over fresh coffee.

Coffee total volume sales grew 13% during the year, leading all Asia-Pacific countries, largely on gains made from instant standard coffee. Instant standard coffee has registered the strongest growth since 2005 due to its lower price point and several other competitive advantages it enjoys over fresh coffee. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In Thailand, retail sales of coffee machines remain low. Of every 100 households, only five have a coffee machine, compared to seven or eight households in ten in the US. With the still low penetration of coffee machines, fresh ground coffee, fresh coffee beans and coffee pods consequently remain niche categories.  Visits to premium coffee specialists have also been declining since 2007 as consumers cut discretionary spending in light of economic hardship, resulting in slower growth for fresh ground coffee and fresh coffee beans, particularly in the on-trade channel.</p>
<h2>Health and wellness positioning </h2>
<p>But it is a continued focus on new products that has done the most to prevent instant coffee from becoming a saturated and stagnant category in Thailand.  Due to a growing consumer concern for health, manufacturers have continued to add products with health and wellness attributes to their portfolios, such as 4-in-1 products with additional ingredients such as collagen, ginseng extract or white bean. Manufacturers are also offering 3-in-1 products with less sugar to cater for those concerned about their sugar intake. Moreover, manufacturers are tending to charge relatively higher prices for these products on the premise that they offer consumers various health benefits. </p>
<p>Nestlé (Thailand) Ltd introduced a number of 'healthy' products over 2007-2009. The company added Nescafé 3-in-1 Less Sweet to its 3-in-1 range to cater to those worried about their sugar intake.  Nescafé Protect is a new coffee line which claims to have been processed in a way to preserve the antioxidants (polyphenols) in coffee beans to allow the product to have three times more antioxidants than green tea.</p>
<p></p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\35b0cede-b761-46fd-949f-e191555f6c0a.JPG""><p>In 2009, the company launched Nescafé Protect Pro Slim, a line extension of Nescafé Protect which is the first brand under the Nutrition & Wellness range by Nescafé that has a slimming claim. Its price is more expensive than normal instant coffee at Bt10/sachet (standard 3-in-1 coffee is priced about Bt3.5/sachet). The product is marketed specifically towards Thai women who are concerned about their shape and digestive health. Nescafé enjoys a commanding lead of more than 70% of instant coffee sales in large part through being the first to market with these sorts of innovations.</p>
<p>Other leading manufacturers have also adopted the same strategy, as seen from ongoing product launches such as Super Coffee Mix Super Instant Ginseng Coffee from Super Coffeemix Mfg Pte Ltd and Khao Shong Coffee Mix with Collagen from Khao Shong Industry 1979 Co Ltd.  Apart from added vitamins, calcium and minerals, manufacturers will tend to add functional ingredients like ginseng, white bean, black sesame and natural grains to their hot drinks, due to the fact that Thai consumers are quite familiar with the tastes and benefits of these ingredients.</p>
<h2>Flavour variety a key product strategy</h2>
<p>The demands of Thai consumers in terms of flavour have become more complex as consumers have become more exposed to coffees from international markets via the mass media and travel. Strong growth of gourmet products is being seen, even if such products attract only a small number of consumers in the Thai market, and this trend is motivating manufacturers to develop flavours to target affluent consumers.</p>
<p>For example, Nestlé (Thailand) Co Ltd offers three levels of coffee intensity in its Nescafé 3-in-1 My Cup - Mild, Original and Turbo. The company also offers Italian 3-in-1 instant coffee to target Italian coffee lovers, with Nescafé Mocca, Nescafé Vanilla Kiss and Nescafé Cappuccino.   New Concept Product Co Ltd offers Coffee with Ginger to target health-conscious coffee drinkers, and has also extended this idea of offering a variety of flavour strengths to its core tea line.  The company features different levels of ginger in its Hotta Instant Ginger Tea, with Original Ginger for a moderate ginger taste, 100% Ginger for a strong ginger taste without added sugar and Concentrated Ginger for a very strong ginger taste.  Giving consumers more flavour options has helped increase loyalty to these brands and also increased their versatility, as milder formulations are more appealing for consumption later in the day. </p>
<h2>Convenience through packaging</h2>
<p>Smaller single-serve pack sizes are increasingly found in convenience stores, chained forecourt retailers or independent grocery retailers in Thailand to serve demand for impulse purchases. Thus, although some consumers do not consume coffee regularly they may occasionally buy a small single-serve pack for a treat or just to try. Most small packs can be sold in multiples and some independent small grocers or supermarkets open boxes and sell individual sachets. The smaller sizes help make products more affordable to a wider number of consumers and for this reason are also a reliable method to attract new coffee drinkers. </p>
<p>In order to cater for increasingly on-the-go lifestyles, there has been an increasing number of 3-in-1 coffee products packaged in plastic cups with a plastic lid, which are ready to drink when boiling water is added and are easy to carry while on the go. This type of product is mainly available in leading convenience stores and chained forecourt retailers.</p>
<h2>Importance of innovation will grow</h2>
<p>Despite a strong 2009 performance, the volume growth of coffee is likely to slow over the course of the next five years as the consumer base matures. Thus, instead of encouraging consumers to drink more, successful manufacturers will aim to focus on value-added products to maintain value growth.  Instant coffee will likely remain the best performer and attract increasing numbers of players, making it easy for slow moving brands to get left behind. Offering a wider range of tastes and coffee strengths, as well as added functional ingredients like collagen, co-enzyme Q10, white bean or dietary fibre will be necessary to make products more appealing to health and beauty-conscious consumers, who also seem willing to absorb the higher prices of such products if the added benefit is clearly conveyed.</p>

Coffee price spike puts pressure on manufacturers,"Green coffee prices hit 13 year highs for much of late August and early September 2010 on a rally sparked by supply concerns for the major arabica producing regions of Brazil and Colombia.  At what looks to be the peak of the price rise on September 8, coffee futures were at US$1.9865 for Dec 2010 contracts.  This was more than 50% higher than June 2010.  ","<p>Green coffee prices hit 13 year highs for much of late August and early September 2010 on a rally sparked by supply concerns for the major arabica producing regions of Brazil and Colombia.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Volatility in coffee pricing on the supply side is nothing new and usually has very little short term effect on retail prices. Such a rapid price increase, though, has proven very difficult for manufacturers to absorb and has led to a variety of responses.  At a time when the global economic recovery is still tenuous, being forced to increase prices is not an advantageous position for coffee manufacturers. </p>
<h2>Low stockpiles and further speculation</h2>
<p>The recent price increases came as a variety of factors combined to cast doubt on the ability for world supply of coffee to meet demand.  Colombia, the world's second largest arabica producer, saw the worst outbreak of a damaging fungus in 25 years and the second straight season plagued by heavy rains, leading to speculation that coffee output would be down for a third straight year in 2011.  2009's coffee crop was the worst seen since 1976.</p>
<p>Brazil, the world's largest arabica producer, was expected to offset some of these declines thanks to a January 2010 forecast harvest of a record 48.7 million bags.  But this was later revised downward to 47.2 million bags due to less rainfall than usual.  This still marked a 20% increase from the 2009 harvest.  But in the meantime US stockpiles were at 10 year lows, down 35% to 2.01 million bags according to ICE Futures.  All of this comes as consumer demand for coffee is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h2>Impact on retail coffee prices</h2>
<p>In August, the pressure became too much for many of the major manufacturers to bear.  The JM Smucker Co announced 10% price increases on its Folgers, Millstone, and Dunkin Donuts retail brands.  Kraft Foods Inc followed suit with 9% increases on its Maxwell House and Yuban coffees.  In September, K-Cup manufacturer Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc announced a round of 10-15% retail price increases starting October 11.    </p>
<p>One notable exception was Starbucks Corp, which said it would instead absorb the increased costs without raising its prices and predicted a four cent per share drag on fiscal 2011 earnings.  However, on August 31, the company debuted a new streamlined drive thru menu at its chained outlets.  The new menus reduce the number of offerings from 70 to 25 and leave the smaller 12 oz Tall size conspicuously absent, while still showing the larger (and more expensive) Grande 16 oz and Venti 20 oz sizes.  This touched off a strong reaction among consumer blogs claiming that Starbucks was trying to surreptitiously pass along a price increase by encouraging further spending.  The company responded quickly, saying that the menu design was instead inspired by consumer preferences and pointing out that the Tall size can still be ordered upon request.  The need for greater menu space was also prompted by a new US regulation requiring nutritional information to be posted for all restaurants beginning in 2011.  Whatever the actual motivation, the timing of this change will undoubtedly lead to increased purchasing of larger sizes at a time when the company wants to see greater spending per transaction.</p>
<h2>Private label threat</h2>
<p>The march to increase retail coffee prices carries with it some risk.  Unlike other recent fluctuations seen in commodities like wheat and oil, coffee is not an essential purchase to most consumers and there is always the chance they will not be willing to pay the higher prices.  One indicator of this trend has been the recent strength of private label coffee sales.  During the recession years of 2008 and 2009, private label coffees gained 0.3 percentage points of world retail value sales, according to Euromonitor International figures.  In the US, consumers turned even more strongly away from branded coffees and private label saw its retail value share grow by nearly 2 full percentage points from 2007-2009.  As retail spending growth continues to lag behind GDP increases in 2010, the environment may still be one of frugality, and price increases could spur a further trading down to cheaper coffees.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Private Label Coffee Share Increasing</h4>
<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\da6ae21f-87c2-4d49-ad06-9a384a64ae8d.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h2>Robusta alternative</h2>
<p>One other option available to coffee manufacturers would be to cut production costs by substituting some arabica with cheaper robusta coffees.  Arabica coffee is typically priced about twice that of robusta but early September prices showed it 2.6 times higher.  Robusta, typically used in instant and espresso blends, is also sourced from different areas of the world than arabica.  Vietnam is the world's largest robusta producer and expects an 8% gain in production to 20 million bags in 2010, according to a recent ABN Amro report.  Mid-priced and economy coffees in particular could benefit from a switch without significantly altering the quality of their products.</p>
<h2>Trouble only temporary?</h2>
<p>However, recent developments may already be easing price pressures on manufacturers.  The Brazil harvest is still expected to represent a surplus, and the expected damage from wet weather in Colombia did not materialize.  According to Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers, August production was up 55%.  Global arabica supply is now projected to exceed demand in 2011 by 6.67 million bags according to a recent ABN Amro report, more than six times earlier projections.  By the second week of September, prices had already begun to come down as speculators reduced their bets on further price inflation.  </p>
<p>If the rally is indeed over, history is also on the side of short term speculation having driven prices rather than more systemic supply problems.  The last rapid rally like this in 2005 saw arabica prices fall by nearly 40% in the six months following the peak.  Such a reduction could lead to retail coffee prices being cut once more by early 2011, helping manufacturers stay competitive against private label and cheaper brands.  The price volatility over the last few months underscores the few supply options open to coffee manufacturers.  While the ultimate impact may be limited this time, there is still the danger of the retail price gap with private label widening once again on short notice.  Successful manufacturers will need to be clear in articulating the added value their brands offer to consumers, or they run the risk of crossing the boundary of what they will be willing to pay.</p>

"Mature Australian coffee shop sector continues to evolve, expand","Already the world's fifth-largest specialist coffee shop market by sales, Australia continues to see growing demand for speciality coffee, with local giants like Gloria Jean's facing increasing competition from both foreign chains and fast food operators like McDonald's. ","<p>Already the world's fifth-largest specialist coffee shop market by sales, Australia continues to see growing demand for speciality coffee, with local giants like Gloria Jean's facing increasing competition from both foreign chains and fast food operators like McDonald's. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Now a US$1.3 billion market, specialist coffee shops in Australia are just one component of a much broader coffee culture, with Australians among the most avid coffee-drinkers on Earth in per capita terms. Thriving markets exist for both at-home and foodservice consumption, as well as for both instant and fresh coffee. While ample opportunities exist for newcomers to make their mark, share gains are not to be assumed—Australian consumer habits and local brands are both well-entrenched, and establishing a presence on the continent should be seen as very much a long-term project. </p>
<h2>McDonald's strides ahead, while Starbucks retrenches</h2>
<p>Australian cafe culture has a long history, with its origins in the wave of Italian immigration to the country in the 1940's and 1950's. To this day, the majority of coffee sold in Australia is consumed through foodservice channels, in contrast to markets like the UK, where two-thirds of coffee is sold for home consumption, or the US, where fully 80% of coffee volume is sold through retail, again for at-home consumption. The Italian influence also persists in the types of coffee beverages consumed—while instant coffee is king for at-home consumption, espresso is preferred in cafes, with filter coffee still unpopular through the specialist coffee shop channel. This environment has produced a number of coffee drinks long unique to Australia and New Zealand, including the flat white (a smaller, less-foamy take on the cappuccino) and the long black (a double espresso shot pulled over hot water, retaining the crema, or foam, of the espresso). Australia is home to more than 2,700 specialist coffee shops, one for every 8300 people, one of the highest penetration rates in the world. </p>
<p>All of this has combined to create a highly competitive market with very specific preferences, one where foreign chains have often struggled. The most famous example of this is Starbucks, which closed 61 of its 85 Australian outlets in 2008, pulling out of some of the country's largest cities altogether. Unlike the US, where the chain was able to sell cafe culture to many consumers for the first time, a strong, existing coffee shop sector in major cities blunted much of Starbucks' appeal in Australia, while the chain's failure to adapt to Australian tastes largely completed the job. By contrast, McDonald's McCafe concept has proven extraordinarily successful—the chain now operates close to 500 McCafe outlets across the country, making it Australia's largest coffee chain in both unit and sales terms. Indeed, the now-global McCafe concept was actually conceived in Australia in 1993, as McDonald's franchisees there looked to drive beverage sales among customers who remain among the most avid consumers of both coffee and fast food in the world. The contrast with Starbucks' abject failure in Australia is instructive—while McDonald's is likewise a foreign brand (albeit one of long standing in Australia), the McCafe concept was from the beginning a consumer-led phenomenon, with Australian preferences helping to drive both outlet and menu design. What's more, McDonald's vast outlet presence has allowed it considerable latitude in outlet placement, with the chain able to achieve a significant presence in areas where competition is low, rather than looking to compete head-to-head in highly competitive high street locations in cities like Melbourne or Sydney. </p>
<h3>Opportunities there to be had</h3>
<p>Despite its already-considerable size, the coffee industry in Australia is expected to continue expanding, with foodservice volume sales alone projected to average better than 3% annual growth over the next five years. Forecast sales through specialist coffee shops are even stronger, with units, sales, and transactions all expected to accelerate going forward. As seen elsewhere, this is expected to attract further interest from outside the sector, with other fast food and quick-service chains looking to match the strong sales of McDonald's McCafes. Sales of fresh coffee are expected to outstrip those of instant through retail, potentially creating opportunities for strong specialist coffee shop brands to build a supermarket presence. </p>
<p>Among coffee shop operators, however, the move towards an ever more-premium experience shows no signs of abating—“microroasters” offering premium coffees are now widely dispersed through Australia's major cities, with even independent coffee shops now offering customised blends. While this mirrors trends seen elsewhere, the process is likely further along given the long history of coffee shops in Australia. For any foreign chain looking to establish a beachhead here, high-end is likely the way to go—with chains like McDonald's quickly locking up the value-priced end of the spectrum and even independents steadily moving upmarket, consistent quality is likely to be the key differentiator for the foreseeable future. The potential rewards are considerable—with a relatively small, yet affluent population concentrated in a few major cities, a strong brand can build fast—yet the competition will remain fierce. Unlike in many emerging markets, simply selling the “coffee shop experience” is not nearly enough, and failure to adequately understand Australian tastes and preferences will not go unpunished for long. </p>

Green Mountain continues North American coffee expansion with Canada’s Van Houtte,"On September 14, 2010, K-Cup manufacturer Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) agreed to buy Canadian coffee manufacturer Van Houtte Inc from equity firm Littlejohn & Co for US$890 million.  The deal offers several strategic advantages for GMCR, and is the fourth major acquisition for the company in the last two years, following its earlier purchases of K-Cup licensees Tully's, Diedrich, and Timothy's World Coffee.","<p>On September 14, 2010, K-Cup manufacturer Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) agreed to buy Canadian coffee manufacturer Van Houtte Inc from equity firm Littlejohn &amp; Co for US$890 million.  The deal offers several strategic advantages for GMCR, and is the fourth major acquisition for the company in the last two years, following its earlier purchases of K-Cup licensees Tully's, Diedrich, and Timothy's World Coffee.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Control of the K-Cup platform</h2>
<p>The first major benefit of the deal for GMCR is that the company will now have full control of its K-Cup pod coffee brewing system.  After purchasing Keurig, the manufacturer of K-Cup machines, in 2006, GMCR had set up a system where it manufactured K-Cups under its namesake Green Mountain Coffee brand, but licensed the technology to several other partners with their own manufacturing and distribution capacity as well.  This was done in particular to quickly expand the reach of the Keurig system into regions such as the Western US and Canada where GMCR did not have much of an existing presence.  </p>
<p>Following the recent success of K-Cups however, GMCR has embarked on a new strategy of buying out its licensees to bring this capacity in house, as well as adding flexibility to its brand portfolio that could be extended across its entire North American operations.  Van Houtte represented the last major independent licensee and as such the deal completes this consolidation process.</p>
<p> 	In the early 2000s, Van Houtte partnered with R.C. Bigelow Inc, a leading specialty tea manufacturer in the US. At first, Van Houtte provided sales and distribution to help Bigelow Tea penetrate the Quebec foodservice market; however, soon after the two companies formed an alliance to produce Bigelow Tea K-Cups. In 2009, both companies worked towards developing the K-Cup market in all parts of the US through major distribution channels. Furthermore, Van Houtte and Wolfgang Puck Coffee signed a joint venture agreement for the roasting, packaging and distribution of Wolfgang Puck K-Cup packs in the US and Canada in February 2010. </p>
<h2>Major Canadian player</h2>
<p>Even without its K-Cup manufacturing business, Van Houtte represents a significant upgrade to GMCR's presence in the Canadian marketplace through its Van Houtte, Brûlerie St. Denis, Les Cafés Orient Express Coffee and Brûlerie Mont Royal specialty brands. Van Houtte Inc held the third largest share of coffee sales in Canada in retail value terms in 2009, after Kraft Canada Inc and JM Smucker Canada Inc. This was due to its dominance of fresh coffee beans, in which it held the leading value share of 15% in 2009. Van Houtte also held the third largest value share in fresh ground coffee, due to its high unit prices. Van Houtte's strong position leverages a well-known brand name, as it has been one of the pioneers in fresh coffee in Canada. Currently, over 4,000 Canadian supermarkets carry the Van Houtte brand of coffee.</p>
<p> 	In addition, the company runs 70 cafés in the province of Quebec. Van Houtte Inc's Coffee Service division encompasses Selena Coffee and Red Carpet in Canada, and Filterfresh in the US, and services over 70,000 workplaces in many of the major cities on the continent. The Coffee Group division is the largest Canadian coffee roaster and distributor of gourmet coffee to retailers. </p>
<h2>Stage is set for K-Cup growth</h2>
<p>Van Houtte's leadership in office coffee sales is an intriguing aspect of the merger, as single serve coffee pods have done particularly well in this channel.  While earlier pod machines like Senseo and Tassimo had trouble connecting with North American retail consumers more accustomed to traditional coffee machines or coffee specialist chains like Starbucks, K-Cups have built a stronger following in the region in part through office sales.  Retail consumers have proven more willing to purchase single serve Keurig machines for home use as they have become familiar with them in the workplace, and offices continue to adopt the systems as a way of offering greater flavour variety to their employees.</p>
<p>However, GMCR has already announced plans to conduct a strategic review of the Filterfresh US division with the intent of selling it and using the proceeds to pay down some of its debt.  In the US, GMCR has already built an extensive distribution network through independent Keurig distributors and its earlier acquisitions, creating some overlap. </p>
<p>Thus, the primary benefit for GMCR will be further expansion into the Canadian coffee market.  Van Houtte has been a Keurig licensee since 2001, and the two companies have a complimentary emphasis on premium quality coffees.  According to company sources, Van Houtte's brands already accounted for more than half of GMCR's North American sales.  GMCR will now be able to bring these brands to more areas of the US, as well as using Van Houtte's roasting, manufacturing, and distribution resources to bring the full breadth of the GMCR K-Cup portfolio to all of Canada.  Very few other coffee manufacturers have the immediate ability to match this kind of market coverage, and those that do are typically focused on fresh ground and fresh bean coffees as the majority of their business and not coffee pods.  Already a market leader in this segment, GMCR is now poised to extend that lead across North America for years to come.</p>

Pod coffee goes mainstream in Germany,"In Germany, the introduction of pods and capsules has revolutionised the way people consume hot drinks and has offered the industry a new lease of life and enormous growth potential. ","<p>In Germany, the introduction of pods and capsules has revolutionised the way people consume hot drinks and has offered the industry a new lease of life and enormous growth potential. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The social life of Germans, particularly in large cities, revolves around cafés, bars and restaurants, chatting over cups of cappuccino, lattes, teas and hot chocolate. A chunk of their leisure time is spent in these outlets and, therefore, the ability to prepare café-quality hot drinks at home, quickly and without effort, appeals to modern-day, time-poor consumers. </p>
<p>Coffee pods had a volume share of 10% and a value share of 22% of fresh ground coffee in 2009, up from a volume share of 1% and a value share of 3%in 2004.  The popularity of single-portion fully automatic machines illustrates the country's changing consumer habits, towards a greater choice of different coffees, brewed one cup at a time and served quick and hot. </p>
<h2>System diversity creates multiple market entry opportunities</h2>
<p>Currently, the non-patented Senseo pod system is known as the open system as it does not take only Senseo branded coffee and hot chocolate, but also Pickwick branded tea pods. The Senseo machines are manufactured by Philips, which creates consumer credibility.  Retailers and discounters have been able to target the open system and have launched a variety of private label coffee pods, with product ranges eventually expected to be extended to all hot drinks.  Around 50% of coffee pods were sold as private label in 2009, with Aldi having a large share.</p>
<p>This growing popularity of cheaper private label pods has led other branded manufacturers to create a newer, more premium tier of pods to differentiate, and as a result many are increasingly counting on capsule systems. Three players dominate capsules, with their patented systems known as 'closed systems', which are exclusive to them. Kraft Foods has launched Tassimo and T Discs, whilst Tchibo has launched Cafissimo and Nestlé has launched Nespresso and Nescafé Dolce Gusto. </p>
<p> 	As other established coffee producers enter the coffee pod arena, they tend to also take this route, in the hopes that their brand equity can lure consumers to a new product category, even if this differs from earlier positioning.  For example, Melitta's marketing strategy surrounding the recent launch of its coffee pod range of five products under the brand name 'Up & Awake' targeted 20-39-year-old affluent consumers. This is a new strategy for Melitta, which has an image as a traditional brand, with a focus on housewives. </p>
<h2>New launches, private label to drive future growth</h2>
<p>Coffee pods will have a 15% share of volume sales and a 33% share of value sales of fresh ground coffee by 2014, according to Euromonitor International data. In tea and other hot drinks, pod and capsules share will also increase although it was still very small in 2009. The future growth potential and the value generated by these products will depend very much on the activities of the leading players as well as those of private label producers. It is likely that the industry will continue to expand into new product ranges and focus on new consumer segments in order to further expand the earning potential of pods and capsules in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Although capsules have been exclusive to the three leading players, this might change in future. Krüger GmbH & Co KG is hoping to launch a capsule system for retailers' private label items known as the K-system, which includes a machine. Although it will be patented, Krüger will allow each retailer to have its own private label logo and brands in order to individualise it. Already, many retailers have shown an interest, and, if it goes ahead, it will pose heavy competition to the leading players. It will also break the monopoly the leading players have and take capsules into the mass market, with less value growth potential as a result. </p>
<p>Germany is one of the world's most dynamic markets for coffee pod household penetration and a growing consumer acceptance of pod systems over traditional fresh coffee is expected to continue. In the midst of an increasingly crowded array of options on the shelf, branded manufacturers will need to move beyond “me too” styles of coffee pods and focus on unique value added propositions.  Machines with attractive design elements can help a brand stand out, but novel technological features and unique pod flavours and varieties will be needed to hold consumers' interest, especially with such a strong private label presence in the marketplace.</p>

Cafe Coffee Day’s Lounge concept charts new course in India coffee shops,"Looking to drive further traffic from young, upper-income professionals, India's Cafe Coffee Day has opened the first outlet in its new Lounge concept, mixing upscale ambience with a radically expanded menu.","<p>Looking to drive further traffic from young, upper-income professionals, India's Cafe Coffee Day has opened the first outlet in its new Lounge concept, mixing upscale ambience with a radically expanded menu.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The new concept represents a dramatic expansion in Cafe Coffee Day's food offer, bringing the chain into closer competition with fast food and casual dining chains, while also highlighting the remarkably brisk evolution of specialist coffee shops in India. While the category overall continues to expand rapidly, there is already a striking amount of segmentation underway, with the largest chains aggressively targeting different consumer groups with a wide array of outlet and menu concepts. Interestingly, this trend is in some ways more advanced in India than in many higher-income markets, potentially offering insights to specialist coffee shop operators looking to grow share in markets where penetration rates are far higher. </p>
<h2>Upgrading the experience</h2>
<p>In describing the new Lounge format, which currently consists of just one outlet in the high-tech hub of Bangalore, CCD officials have talked of the need for a higher-end experience, one that matches the aspirations of the chain's increasingly-affluent core of consumers. To this end, the company has created an outlet concept with a more contemporary interior design and an expanded array of coffees and teas, including a number of highly-indulgent blended coffee drinks. What's more, the new concept offers a broader selection of food and beverages than standard CCD outlets—the Lounge's menu includes hamburgers, salads, appetizers, and a wide variety of non-alcoholic drinks, including smoothies and fruit juice blends. </p>
<p>While CCD already operates the upscale Coffee Day Square concept, the positioning of those outlets is rather different—Square outlets retain a heavy emphasis on coffee, with a wide selection of premium single estate products as well as home-brewing equipment for sale. The Lounge concept, by contrast, feels much more like a trendy club, or a high-end fast casual chain with a really excellent coffee selection—rather than staking a claim on the highest end of the premium coffee market, the Lounge clearly represents CCD's efforts to establish itself as a destination throughout the day and into the night, expanding both average check and the range of potential eating occasions. </p>
<h3>“Fourth wave” breaking? </h3>
<p>CCD has announced ambitious plans for its Lounge concept, with a goal of opening 50 outlets in the new design by the end of the year, through a combination of new openings and refitting existing outlets. The move reinforces the chain's continuing strategy of careful market segmentation, with high-end Lounge and Square outlets complemented by standard Cafe Coffee Day and fast, low-priced Xpress locations. What's more, it illustrates the shifts taking place in the specialist coffee shops category on a global level—Coffee Day Square, for instance, is very much in keeping with the emerging “third wave” of coffee shops, with its strong emphasis on rare, high-quality coffees and roasts, with the appreciation of coffee taking centre stage. By contrast, Coffee Day Lounge offers a glimpse of what might become coffee's “fourth wave,” with coffee serving as the nucleus of something much closer to a restaurant-style experience, as operators look to blur the lines between specialist coffee shops, traditional cafes and bistros, and other quick-service categories. </p>
<p>More broadly, the rise of Cafe Coffee Day is a stark illustration of a real shift in the balance of chained foodservice innovation—the specialist coffee shop category in India has evolved at a radically accelerated rate, in part due to the surging growth in disposable income seen over the last five years. At the same time, the quest for growth across a highly diverse consumer base has encouraged a highly segmented outlet model which can drive sales across a wide range of income levels. In the process, chains like CCD have developed a strategy similar to that of many operators in more developed markets, albeit in response to a completely different set of competitive pressures--in highly saturated markets where consumer spending remains sluggish, greater segmentation and more focussed outlet designs can prove vital in taking share. The lesson to operators everywhere, in every sector, is that insights can and do come from anywhere, and the best practices of emerging chains in many developing markets can often prove equally powerful elsewhere.</p>

Coffee in the UAE benefits from changing consumer tastes,"The United Arab Emirates represents the fastest growing market by volume for coffee in the world, despite the country falling into recession by the fourth quarter of 2008.   Total coffee volume sales are predicted to grow by 80% from 2009-2014 with a CAGR of more than 12% over that time period.  ","<p>The United Arab Emirates represents the fastest growing market by volume for coffee in the world, despite the country falling into recession by the fourth quarter of 2008.   Total coffee volume sales are predicted to grow by 80% from 2009-2014 with a CAGR of more than 12% over that time period.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>This growth also comes amidst a still dominant tea drinking tradition in the country. With more than 50% of the UAE's population hailing from East Asia and the Indian Subcontinent, this expatriate population provides the appropriate consumer base for tea. Tea is usually drunk at many times during the day, often alongside or after meals. Not only is tea a traditional favourite within this community, it is also cheaper than coffee.</p>
<p>How, then, has coffee managed to make such an impression on consumers in the UAE?  The country's recent period of great economic development helped to create several new points of entry for higher quality coffees.  Once the recession began to take hold, a shift in consumer tastes had already begun, one that continues to drive coffee purchases even as overall consumer expenditure has been reigned in. Surprisingly, growth was driven primarily through the on-trade channel, which continued to reap dividends of the emerging café culture. </p>
<h2>Café culture</h2>
<p>The rise of the café trend was initially set by domestic chain Gerard's in the early 1990's. The café culture began materialising with the influx of international chains that started taking place by the mid to late 1990's, amid the emergence of shopping centres, in which many cafés are located. Spending in cafes increased significantly, by 119%, between 2005 and 2008, reaching US$454 million, according to Euromonitor International data. The buoyant coffee culture prompted the emergence of local coffee chains such as Blends & Brews; however, the abundance of cafés from all corners of the world staved off the development of domestic ones. The United Arab Emirates arguably houses the presence of some of the largest international cafés in the world, including Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Seattle's Best Coffee, Barista, Hédiard, Café Nero, Café Supreme, Blenz, Second Cup, Segafredo Zanetti, Illy and Lavazza. Such presence has so far succeeded in converting the United Arab Emirates consumer – whether national or expatriate – into a regular coffee drinker. </p>
<p>While coffee shops have always existed, the contemporary coffee outlet represents a social outlet where all individuals can come together. Traditionally, coffee shops were reserved for men who would gather together to chat while drinking coffee. The main appeal of such shops is the social factor, and they are increasingly popular amongst adolescents and university students. While Dubai does have an active nightlife, for religious reasons drinking and clubbing are usually frowned upon. Most adolescents don't have the option of doing much else than going to coffee shops, especially since it is often too hot for most outdoor activities. Such outlets allow for young people the opportunity to socialize with others in a surrounding that is not considered to be culturally unacceptable. </p>
<p>The increasing number of specialist coffee shops fed through into higher on-trade volume coffee sales, which grew by 17% in 2009 versus a lower growth of 9% for off-trade volume sales. On-trade volume sales accounted for 51% of total volume sales of coffee in 2009, a percentage which has gradually grown from 42% since 2004. Coffee shops are becoming widespread across the country's main cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with a concentration in shopping centres, high streets, educational institutions, airports and business centres.</p>
<h2>Premium market but favourable overall pricing</h2>
<p>In addition to this emerging café culture, a trend of premiumisation also reigned in 2009, beating earlier estimates that the economic slowdown would hamper its development. In 2009, a number of premium brands were launched such as Illy, Whole Earth Organic, Lavazza Dek and Twinings Coffee Blends. </p>
<p>Consumers were also increasingly exposed to the various ways of preparing coffee, especially with the expanding launch of coffee pods. In May 2009, Nestlé Nespresso – the pioneer in premium portioned coffee – opened its first store in the United Arab Emirates at the Dubai Mall. This store was – and will continue to be – instrumental in marketing the company's wide selection of coffee machines and coffee blends, known as Grand Crus. Such innovations have succeeded in bringing the café experience to home or the office and hence opened a new type of premium coffee experience to consumers who might otherwise have avoided coffee altogether. </p>
<p>Even with this emphasis from manufacturers on premium coffee, some trading down was witnessed in 2009 and early 2010, especially among middle-income earners from standard instant brands such as Nescafé to economy brands such as Brooke Bond Bru, which is highly popular among the dominant population hailing from the Indian Subcontinent. There was less trading down within fresh coffee. In terms of pricing, unit prices reflected the lower cost of raw materials in 2009, with the International Coffee Organization (ICO) composite average declining to US¢116.40/lb down from an annual average of US¢124.25/lb in 2008. Although such a drop should have caused a decline in coffee unit prices, suppliers and retailers did not initially factored in the global decline. This scenario prompted the Ministry of Economy to intervene during the first quarter of 2009 and control the prices of certain brands to prevent manipulators from maintaining the 2008 'high' prices.</p>
<h2>Future opportunities for multinationals</h2>
<p>Although premiumisation is expected to slow down through 2011, the trend is set to continue driving the category over the next five years. Consumers' expectations of coffee they can purchase to prepare at home will rise to meet what they expect from a coffee shop, creating further space for international companies to launch premium coffees, something that will take greater time and resources for domestic manufacturers to develop on their own.</p>
<p>In addition, pod machines appear to be here to stay and one would expect there to be a large push for these machines during the coming few years. The prices of pod machines are expected to fall as more competition arrives in the marketplace, ushering in another wave of new popularity among consumers. Although Nestlé's Nespresso holds the first mover advantage, others are likely to follow suit. </p>
<p>It is clear that international coffee chains have begun to realize the potential of the UAE market and it's expected that more international players will be looking to gain a foothold. Additionally, coffee sales do not appear to have been significantly affected by the economic downturn and have continued to increase. Coffee shops are, in fact, perceived as a cheap alternative to dining out and as a venue for socializing, especially among younger people. Multinational coffee manufacturers, with established reputations for quality and an aspirational element to their brands, will continue to find an increasingly receptive consumer audience in the UAE.</p>

Specialist coffee shops make headway in Argentina,"While café culture has a long history in Argentina, modern specialist coffee shops are making considerable gains, with domestic and foreign players taking share in a market where familiarity with traditional cafes runs high. ","<p>While café culture has a long history in Argentina, modern specialist coffee shops are making considerable gains, with domestic and foreign players taking share in a market where familiarity with traditional cafes runs high. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The market is shaping up to become a major growth area over the next five years, as urban residents seek out upgraded versions of the traditional café experience. While there is opportunity here for major global coffee shop chains, local players such as Havanna Café are expected to provide strong competition, with several likely to become serious regional competitors in Latin America. </p>
<h2>Local players lead the way</h2>
<p>Traditionally, Argentinians enjoy spending their time in cafés and bars chatting with friends, reading books, working or studying, while enjoying a small cup of coffee (traditionally nicknamed a 'cafecito'). Because of this strong café culture, cafés/bars is a mature channel in Argentina, with more than 17,400 outlets and close to ARS 12 billion (US$3 billion) in 2009 sales. Although the cafés/bars channel is dominated by independent cafés/bars with a 92% share of sales, this segment grew by at an average rate of 4% in constant value terms over the last five years. In contrast, the  ARS 850 million (US$210 million) chained specialist coffee shops category averaged 19% annual growth in constant value terms over the same period, making it one of Argentina's fastest-growing categories by some margin. </p>
<p>This process was led by local chains like Aroma, Café Martínez, The Coffee Store, Bonafide and Havanna. Aroma, Café Martínez and The Coffee Store were founded as specialist coffee shops and started building their chains in 2000 by means of franchising. In contrast, Bonafide and Havanna were chains which already had a presence in the coffee and chocolate confectionery categories, and so they achieved rapid penetration by transforming their outlets into coffee shops. These new chains are targeting middle and upper-income groups and offer coffees from different origins as well as a specific ambience as a means through which to differentiate themselves from traditional cafés. This new trend has led to a process of consumer sophistication, with Argentinians now drinking beverages such as frappuccinos, lattes, smoothies and shakes.</p>
<p>Generally, local chains begin with a few local outlets, later expanding by means of franchising. As an example, Bonafide only owns seven of its 140 outlets in Argentina. The arrival of McCafé in 2003 and the opening of the first Starbucks outlet in 2008 led to the entrance of international players in this niche. Starbucks is managed by a joint venture company controlled by Alsea SAB de CV from Mexico. McDonald's is managed by a regional partner (Arcos Dorados SA), and has some outlets operated by franchisees.</p>

<h3>A category with room to grow, while local players eye regional expansion</h3>
<p>The leading chains Bonafide and Havanna Café have covered the greatest part of the domestic market and are now focusing their growth outside the country. In contrast, local medium-sized chains have begun to expand into the interior of the country. Among them are Café Martínez, The Coffee Store and Balcarce Café.Starbucks will continue with its strong expansion strategy over the next few years, with the chain projected to open at least 10 new outlets a year. McDonald's is also expected to continue with the expansion of McCafé in its outlets. By the end of 2009, there were 62 McCafés in over 186 McDonald's outlets. The arrival of two new international chains is also expected. Firstly, Italian company Illycafè is seeking to enter the market in 2011. It will seek a local partner to set up its chain of premium coffee shops by means of franchises. Secondly, the Colombian chain Café Valdez also expects to set foot in Argentina next year.</p>
<p>Chained specialist coffee shops is one of the most dynamic channels within consumer foodservice. Because of the expansion of medium-sized local chains, along with strong Starbucks' expansion and the more moderate growth of McCafé, this channel is expected to achieve a CAGR of 9% in constant value terms over the forecast period. Chained specialist coffee shops will account for almost all the growth in cafés/bars, a channel which is forecast to post a constant value CAGR of just 1% over the forecast period. This growth will take place mainly in standalone locations with high footfall, and in shopping centre food courts.</p>

The conundrum of RTD tea and RTD coffee,"RTD tea is on course to generate around US$5 billion of new business this year, roughly double the retail gain achieved in 2009. Meanwhile, the growth prospects of RTD coffee appear stymied despite investment from big-name players. Both sectors are globally ambitious, but Euromonitor International's Rob Walker warns that each faces an uphill struggle to turn niche consumption pockets into more mainstream demand. ","<p>RTD tea is on course to generate around US$5 billion of new business this year, roughly double the retail gain achieved in 2009. Meanwhile, the growth prospects of RTD coffee appear stymied despite investment from big-name players. Both sectors are globally ambitious, but Euromonitor International's Rob Walker warns that each faces an uphill struggle to turn niche consumption pockets into more mainstream demand. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Over-dependence dilutes bullish growth</h2>
<p>Global consumption of RTD tea is tipped to break 30 billion litres this year but, tellingly, three quarters of that volume will be sourced from only four markets, China, Japan, the USA and Indonesia, according to latest available data from Euromonitor International. In fact, there is a higher level of dependency today than a decade ago when the same four markets accounted for 70% of demand. With compound annual growth since 2004 running at 9% by volume, the highest global rate of any soft drinks sector, you could hardly argue that RTD tea was going backwards. Yet, the sector is clearly some way short of breaking into the global beverage mainstream. </p>
<p>If over-dependency is a problem for RTD tea, it is a crisis in the making for RTD coffee, with one market, Japan, accounting for some three quarters of worldwide volume last year. Furthermore, only seven countries registered an annual per capita consumption rate of over 1 litre, according to Euromonitor International. Compare that with carbonates, which stakes claim to more than 70 different countries with a per capita consumption rate in excess of 10 litres. It is a monumental disparity and evidence enough that RTD coffee has a big game of catch-up to play if it is ever going to climb beyond ultra niche status. </p>
<p>Of the industry's two RTDs, tea has shown the biggest mainstream ambition over recent years, emerging as a front runner of a new generation of value enhancing niche categories. Others of this genre include energy drinks, functional water, flavoured milk, soy beverages and drinking yoghurt. Again, though, growth of RTD tea is heavily concentrated in Asian markets, above all China. Last year, for example, consumption in China increased by a whopping 1.6 billion litres, which in turn fuelled around US$1.4 billion of new retail business. This means that China accounted for some 86% of total incremental volume. For a category with global ambition that scale of over-dependence is, quite simply, too high. </p>

<h2>The Eastern comfort zone</h2>
<p>The impressive growth curve in China can be explained to some extent by a natural predisposition to the good-for-you functionality of RTD tea. But, that is only part of the story. Consider the case of carbonates, for example, which scores poorly on good-for-you credentials. That also generated significant new volume in China last year with absolute growth of around 700 million litres. Granted this was less than half the gain of RTD tea, but it shows that wellness drivers were not all pervasive. What seems more likely is that growth in both RTD tea and carbonates was due to a scaling up of demand on the back of intensive urbanisation. </p>
<p>To put this in context, in 1980 China's rural population outnumbered its urban by more than 4 to 1, whereas today the split is virtually even. The population might be ageing, but we are seeing unprecedented rates of urbanisation to the extent that by 2030 there will be more than 200 cities with over one million inhabitants. This vast influx of people to the cities increases the distribution power of RTD tea, bringing leading brands into daily contact with millions of new consumers. The same rationale can be applied to carbonates, and all other soft drinks. It would be a mistake, therefore, to over-emphasise the wellness drivers of RTD tea. They exist, but they are nothing new to China, which has a deep consumption culture for RTD tea. </p>
<p>Given the urbanisation phenomenon, the prognosis for RTD tea looks good in China. It is in the rest of the world where the sector needs to raise its game. Even in Japan, arguably the spiritual home of RTD tea, there is evidence of consumers drifting away. Last year, for example, RTD tea volume contracted 6%, the worst performance of all Japan's soft drinks sectors. On the upside, Japanese consumers continue to drink more RTD tea than any other soft drink, implying there is room for some downward pressure on demand. What seems clear is that we need to look beyond Asia Pacific to get a clearer idea of the sector's real global potential. </p>
<p>If we take Asia Pacific out of the frame, absolute RTD tea growth is forecast at around 300 million litres for 2010, which is nothing to write home about. Fruit/vegetable juice, by contrast, is projected to grow by around one billion litres in non-Asian markets. The good news for the RTD tea sector is that demand is on the rise in the highly prized US market. Last year, RTD tea was one of the fastest growing soft drinks sectors in the country, trailing only functional water in absolute volume terms, and a similarly robust performance is expected this year. In the USA, growing consumer awareness of functionality is rightly identified as a contributing reason for RTD tea growth, but again, we should not over-egg that driver. Growth is also coming from an embedded RTD tea consumption heritage. </p>
<p>In Europe, with the exception of Germany, there is no such consumption tradition for RTD tea. Most strikingly, the sector is a virtual misnomer in the United Kingdom despite its deep-rooted hot tea culture. In fact, the UK's strong hot tea tradition is a probable reason why RTD tea has failed to make an impact. In short, hot tea consumers are often put off by the concept of a cold RTD tea. They fail to identify RTD tea as a fundamentally separate category. Associations with hot tea also work as a barrier to RTD tea development in non-hot tea drinking cultures. In much of Latin America, for example, hot tea is perceived as a digestive, or as a remedy to cure an upset stomach. There is confusion, therefore, regarding the functionality and consumption occasion of RTD formats. It is an identity issue that RTD tea will need to address if it is to break major new ground in Latin America, as well as in Europe. </p>

<h2>No strangers to innovation</h2>
<p>Unlike hot tea, hot coffee yields positive associations for its RTD counterpart, thanks mainly to growing global café culture. Starbucks, notably, has led the way in gourmet coffee education, and helped create a platform for a premium RTD coffee segment. Coca-Cola's joint venture agreement with Italy's Illycaffé Spa in 2008 was indicative of the aspirations of RTD coffee, but also of its limitations. Coca-Cola had attempted on various occasions to kick-start an RTD coffee category, but without much success. The emphasis of the Illy Issimo joint venture was on tapping into demand for more sophisticated soft drinks. And that is the most likely strategic direction of RTD coffee. Like the current generation of energy drinks, the packaging and on-trade occasion profile of RTD coffee lends itself to premium positioning. </p>
<p>When it comes to the critical issue of product development, both RTD tea and RTD coffee will continue to be tough strategic nuts to crack. On paper, the better-for-you attributes of RTD tea ought to act as a springboard to growth. But, in markets where consumers have limited truck with functional issues, an over-emphasis on wellness benefits could work less favourably. Ultimately, RTD tea needs to maximise consumption occasions, so straitjacketing inside too much functionality could be a mistake. Tailored country-specific innovation has some potential, but that means drilling into the functionality drivers of different groups within different countries. Last year, for example, Coca-Cola rolled out a fat burning green tea flavoured cola in Japan, targeting diet-conscious young women. It is the type of ultra specific tailoring that could work for RTD tea. </p>
<p>Pepsi-Lipton's launch last year of a sparkling RTD green tea in the USA was a bold move, but you could also argue that it further complicated the definition of the sector from a consumer perspective. Is RTD tea a still, or a sparkling drink, or like bottled water, is it both? The RTD tea sector has not been shy of innovation over recent years, but to date there has been nothing game changing at the global level. As such, RTD tea and coffee both seem destined to remain comparatively low volume niches outside their small cluster of comfort zones. There is nothing wrong with niche per se, it comes down to how well that niche is developed. One of the biggest tests will be in maximising the value of the niche in those markets with limited RTD tea and coffee culture. Quite clearly, while there are myriad untapped opportunities ahead, there are multiple uncertainties too. </p>

Coffee Innovation in Bulgaria Impacts Tea Drinking Culture,The dynamics behind Bulgaria may be informative for ways of either growing hot drinks volume in other markets or for potential new growth strategies for tea so we will take a closer look at what is driving the rtd volume growth in Bulgaria,"<p>The dynamics behind Bulgaria may be informative for ways of either growing hot drinks volume in other markets or for potential new growth strategies for tea so we will take a closer look at what is driving the rtd volume growth in Bulgaria</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In Bulgaria, instant coffee has been innovating over the past five years.  This innovation has lead to instant coffee going from about half the size of tea in 2004, on a read-to-drink basis, to about the same size as tea in 2009.  Over this period instant coffee ready-to-drink volume increased by almost 53% vs. a 1% increase in tea volume.  From 2004 to 2009, instant coffee contributed 83% of total hot drinks rtd volume growth.</p>
<h2>Manufacturers tailor product features to suit changing demographic factors and evolving lifestyles</h2>
<p>Changing demographic factors and evolving lifestyles compel producers to offer hot drinks products that better suit consumer needs. As many Bulgarians choose to live on their own, work longer hours or exhibit increasing preference towards one-stop shopping, they need smaller pack sizes, hot drinks with added benefits or large value packs. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International projects that the number of single-person households  in Bulgaria will increase by 6,000 by the end of the forecast period, while those households with two or three occupants will decline by 45,000. The number of households with four or five family members, whether they are or are not related, will increase by 18,000. On the other hand, households with children (both couples and single parents) will decline by 110,000. Couples without children will increase by 67,000.</p>
<p>Modern lifestyles have brought a greater degree of urbanisation, a desire for independence and the prioritising of career over free time. At the same time, migration processes from small towns and villages to cities have brought an end to the traditional household structure where young people lived with their parents until marriage. The fact that many young people live on their own in cities (in rented accommodation or their own homes), means that they are more exposed to modern and Western lifestyles. This change in demographics and lifestyle prompts producers to focus more on single-serve packs, larger value packs and products that boast energy-boosting and stress-relieving properties.</p>
<p>The future new product development of hot drinks companies will continue to follow patterns that were established during the review period. Product development according to household size, increasing consumption frequency, ease of preparation, seasonal qualities and wellbeing properties will certainly be employed in imaginative ways by companies that want to expand their shares. Coffee companies will continue to pioneer novelties. The new product developments are likely to focus on premixed coffee specialties that require less effort in their preparation, have reduced calorie content or indulgent properties (such as creamier taste, new flavours and hybrid products linked to other drinks categories).</p>
<p>An example of innovation came in the form of Kraft Foods Bulgaria AD's launch of Don cafe 4-in-1 instant coffee specialties from Doncafe Group, which combine the features of specialty coffee products with those of an energy drink. The products are a true innovation and their unique positioning upgrades the image of coffee specialties. These products also had a positive impact on the development of the niche because they were launched at a moment when the 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 versions were well accepted and consumers were ready for similar formats. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By capitalizing on changing consumer lifestyles, instant coffee has been able to generate growth.  Perhaps with similar innovation, tea will be able to reignite its growth trends.</p>

Recent activity shows growing interest in US coffee pod market,"Single serve pod coffee systems are a relatively new development in the US, working without the same kind of consumer recognition as they enjoy in Western Europe.  After a flurry of brand launches in the middle of the decade, by the late 2000s the Keurig K-Cup system from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) emerged as the clear US leader.  The company has spent much of 2009 and 2010 buying out its licensees, in an effort to consolidate distribution and move brands into new territories.  Bu","<p>Single serve pod coffee systems are a relatively new development in the US, working without the same kind of consumer recognition as they enjoy in Western Europe.  After a flurry of brand launches in the middle of the decade, by the late 2000s the Keurig K-Cup system from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc (GMCR) emerged as the clear US leader.  The company has spent much of 2009 and 2010 buying out its licensees, in an effort to consolidate distribution and move brands into new territories.  But the recent success of GMCR is beginning to attract attention and with it, new competitors looking to find their own piece of coffee pods sales.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>According to upcoming Euromonitor International data, off-trade value sales of coffee pods in the US will surpass US$500 million in 2010, nearly double what was seen in 2009.  This figure also excludes office sales, where pods are also beginning to take a substantial share, so the total market in the US is somewhat larger.  Off-trade coffee pod sales are predicted to double once again by 2013, and in total the market is predicted to grow by an additional US$700 million through 2015.</p>
<p>These figures still represent less than 10% of the more than US$8 billion off trade market for coffee in the US, showing that coffee pods are still a niche, albeit one that appears to finally be gaining traction.  Competing systems like Senseo from Sara Lee Corp, Tassimo from Kraft Foods Inc and Nespresso from Nestlé SA already exist in the US, and Nestlé also launched its Dolce Gusto pod system into Wal-Mart in late 2010.  Euromonitor International examines further potential moves by a newer group of pod manufacturers.</p>
<h2>Peet's looks to rebound after missed opportunity</h2>
<p>In late 2009, Peet's Coffee, a specialty coffee manufacturer with outlets located mainly in the Western US, offered more than US$260 million to purchase Diedrich Coffee, the primary Western US licensee of Keurig K-Cups.  After a series of bids, Peet's eventually lost to GMCR, who purchased Diedrich for more than US$300 million.  </p>
<p>Since then, Peet's has stated their desire to enter the pod coffee business through a different acquisition.  However, the options remain limited, unless Kraft Foods were willing to part with its Tassimo T-Discs.  A more likely route would be to use a system from a smaller manufacturer, such as Mars Inc or Lavazza, and create pods leveraging the Peet's premium coffee brand.  Peet's is sold at nearly 200 of the company's coffee specialist locations, but also in several regional grocery locations, and the company intends to focus more on this CPG business moving forward.</p>
<p>This stated desire to shift to at-home consumption also aligns with the ongoing shift in focus to CPG sales at Starbucks, and opens up the possibility that Peet's itself could become an acquisition target. Speculation over such a deal between the two players has picked up in recent months following comments from Starbucks that they are looking towards more growth through acquisition.  Peet's and Starbucks are both nationally recognized brands that could bring visibility to whichever pod system they decide to use, and help convince consumers to try single serve brewing.</p>
<h2>Starbucks takes aggressive step back from Kraft</h2>
<p>Starbucks surprised many in November 2010 when it announced publicly that it was ending its twelve year distribution relationship with Kraft Foods.  Starbucks to this point has handled product launches and sales through its branded retail outlets, but has relied the distribution strength of licensing partners for its grocery business, including Kraft for Starbucks and Seattle's Best coffees and Tazo teas, and others for licensed products like ice cream and chocolate.  Starbucks now seeks to control more of that process, with an eye towards expanding the pipeline of products offered for at-home consumption.</p>
<p>However, the split with Kraft is proving to be somewhat less than amicable.  After an initial offer to buy out the business was rejected as too low by Kraft, Starbucks changed course and alleged mismanagement on the part of Kraft as grounds for terminating the deal in 2011.  As of early December, Kraft had responded by seeking arbitration and going to court to seek a temporary injunction against Starbucks for violating the agreement.  </p>
<p>Kraft currently makes Starbucks branded coffee pods for its Tassimo T-Disc system, but given the hostile nature of these recent events, it is unlikely that this licensing relationship can be salvaged once the two companies split.  A story in November 2010 linked Starbucks to a new pod system launch based on its Via Ready Brew instant coffee brand.  This was quickly denied by the company, and such a development would take quite a bit of new investment and time.  A far more likely option would be for Starbucks to work with GMCR, the clear market leader, to release K-Cup versions of its Starbucks and Tazo tea brands, or perhaps even purchase GMCR outright.  This way Starbucks would be able to utilize both the leading premium coffee brand and the leading single serve pod system in the US.</p>
<h2>Dunkin Donuts moves ahead on its own</h2>
<p>In October 2010, leading bakery fast food operator Dunkin Brands Inc began to test market a single serve pod based on its popular Dunkin Donuts coffee.  Dunkin' One Cup is a soft pod design, offering greater versatility than proprietary systems like K-Cup and T-Disc.  Dunkin' One Cup pods launched in five flavours and can be used in Senseo machines, but also systems from Cuisinart, Home Café, Black and Decker, Melitta, and Hamilton Beach.</p>
<p>Though the brand is being test marketed on a trial basis, Dunkin does have a network of more than 6000 retail outlets in the US where it could roll out Dunkin One Cup coffee, as well as an existing relationship with The JM Smucker Co for grocery distribution.  Dunkin, therefore, represents one of the few players alongside Starbucks who could have an immediate visibility in the marketplace and a strong impact on the coffee pod category if it decided on a national launch.  </p>
<p>Pod coffee systems to this point have also been viewed in the US as universally premium, higher priced products when compared to normal fresh and instant coffees prepared at home.  Dunkin Donuts has long positioned itself as a more medium priced coffee appealing to price conscious consumers in comparison to its chief competitor Starbucks.  Along with Nestlé's recent Dolce Gusto launch, a second price tier of coffee pods could be one of the primary drivers of growth in 2011 and beyond.  Whatever the format and price point, US manufacturers certainly appear to have taken notice of this new consumer interest in single serve coffee systems.  New partnerships and market entries will likely reshape the offerings on supermarket shelves in the months ahead, either cementing GMCR's position atop the list of players or offering some big name competition that might be able to gain traction where Sara Lee and Kraft could not.</p>

Hot drinks company review 2009/2010: Continuing growth story for coffee pods and change in competitive landscape in other hot drinks,"Coffee pods continue to do well around the globe, growing in Western Europe and attracting interest in North America.

<h2>Coffee: Coffee pods continue to bode well for Nestlé</h2>
<p>Euromonitor International's latest data shows that the company rankings in coffee remain unchanged in 2010, with the top two players, Nestlé and Kraft, jointly accounting for a third of retail value sales. Nestlé has maintained its leadership in 2010, making share gains of around 20 basis points. Market sentiment has obviously moved from gloomy to cautiously optimistic, reflected in the fact that many major coffee companies have picked up some sales thanks to the slow economic recovery. Euromonitor International has noticed that the recession did not discourage or disrupt Nestlé's initial plan to introduce its coffee pod brands to new markets. Nespresso and Nescafé Dolce Gusto have continued to see sales grow, particularly in major Western European markets, despite growing competition. Nestlé's pod coffee is even becoming visible and recognisable beyond Western Europe, and is actively being marketed in Japan, Uruguay, Australia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>In US dollar retail value terms, Kraft (4%) has underperformed Nestlé (9%) and Sara Lee (9%) in 2009/2010. Affected by the recession and intense competition, Kraft has continued to record sluggish sales in certain major developed Western markets such as France, Germany and the US. As these markets carry a heavy weight in terms of Kraft's global scale, their poor performances have affected the company's overall pace of growth. Not so good news is the fact that recovery in other markets such as South Korea, Russia, Poland and Sweden is unlikely to offset the overall sluggishness.</p>
<p>Despite the fragile economic recovery, North America's coffee market has had an interesting and exciting 2010, reflected in significant merger and acquisition activity. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) has been in a particularly acquisitive mood over the past two years, acquiring K-Cup licensees Tully's, Diedrich and Timothy's World Coffee and Canadian coffee manufacturer Van Houtte. GMCR is now the third largest coffee company by retail value sales in Canada. Although US consumer appetite for coffee pods is not as high as in Western Europe thus far, it is evident that interest in the niche category is growing. </p>
<p>Starbucks has bounced back in 2009/2010 following a poor 2008/2009, and the company has expressed its ambition to achieve multi-channel distribution in the years to come given that the US foodservice channel is very mature and slow. Its VIA instant coffee is likely to be the focus of its retail growth ambitions. Recently, Starbucks announced that it is to terminate its distribution agreement with Kraft and go it alone. Euromonitor International's latest forecasts predict that Starbucks is expected to see its instant coffee sales in the US increase from US$14 million in 2009 to US$100 million in 2010. This is encouraging for Starbucks, but worrying for its competitors. </p>

<h2>Tea: Atlantic Grupa acquires Droga Kolinska</h2>
<p>Compared to the dynamics in coffee, the tea industry has seen a quiet 2009/2010. Unilever has maintained its leadership with around a 15% share in 2010. Tata Tea Ltd was renamed Tata Global Beverages and stated its ambition to transform itself from an Indian tea specialist into a global company carrying a comprehensive line of beverages. Tata's joint venture with PepsiCo, established in 2010, has explicitly demonstrated this corporate goal. However, it remains to be seen how Tetley, as Tata's international face, will grow its business going forward. Will it start to acquire and expand into more beverages as its parent company intends to do or will it continue to focus on tea in the years to come? </p>
<p>Orimi has seen a swift recovery in US dollar value terms in 2009/2010 thanks to Russia's macroeconomic recovery. Orimi has announced an international expansion plan as well as making a great deal of effort to develop premium hot drinks domestically. In the global tea arena, Orimi registers shares mainly in Eastern European countries, although its total sales are comparable to those of Associated British Foods (ABF), with the latter having broader geographical coverage. This means that if Orimi is able to maintain its sales in Eastern Europe and grow its international business, it may well be in a good position to overtake second-ranked Tata over the medium term. This prospect could potentially make Orimi an attractive acquisition target. However, as a private company, Orimi does not disclose financial information or business agreements, and anyone who is interested in the company would need further clarification before making an offer. </p>
<p>Although no major merger and acquisition activity has impacted the global rankings in 2009/2010, some regional activities are worth noting. Croatian-based Atlantic Grupa dd's acquisition of Droga Kolinska (based in Slovenia) has raised its profile in the Eastern European tea market, increasing its value share by 20 basis points in 2009/2010. Atlantic is a major distributor of FMCG brands such as Wrigley, Ferrero and Hipp in Southeast Europe and also produces a vast variety of consumer goods. Previously privately-owned, Droga Kolinska is involved in both coffee and tea and its products are sold in many European countries. Becoming part of the large Atlantic family may eventually give Droga Kolinska a better geographical balance. Atlantic recently signed an agreement with Austrian-based energy drinks player Red Bull to distribute its brands in Croatia, thus showing the strength of the company and its growth potential. </p>
<p>China, the homeland of tea, continues to consume vast amounts of unpackaged tea. Whilst it remains a massive challenge to persuade consumers to buy commercially packaged products, instant tea, with its new format, convenient packaging and modern lifestyle promise, has really taken off in this oldest of tea-drinking nations. Hence, Chinese companies which involved in this relatively new category have an advantage over unpackaged tea players. Banking on the 1.3 billion population, Guangdong Strong (Group) Co Ltd and Zhejiang Xiangpiaopiao Co Ltd have raised their profile and effectively squeezed into the top 10 on the global stage.</p>

<h2>Other hot drinks: Kraft's share gain through Cadbury acquisition</h2>
<p>Kraft's acquisition of Cadbury Plc has been the biggest story in the other hot drinks category (malt, chocolate powder and other plant-based drinks). Kraft has improved its global share from 1.3% in 2009 to 4.5% in 2010 as a direct result of the purchase and now the American giant is competing head-to-head with the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). At this moment in time, it is not known how Kraft plans to grow Cadbury's established brands over the years to come. However, Kraft's strong influence on the category should theoretically be an underlying threat to both GSK and Associated British Foods (ABF) going forward. </p>
<p>Nestlé has maintained its leadership of the category and is expected to see total retail sales of US$3.2 billion in 2010. The category has always appeared to be a neglected but sweet child in the hot drinks industry. It should be noted that it has appeared somewhat recession-proof and highly resilient. </p>
<p>ABF's rapid development in a few markets (Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia and Australia) has attracted analysts' attention in recent years. ABF's progress in Brazil is particularly impressive thanks to a series of aggressive marketing campaigns. Specifically, ABF's sales in this category in Brazil are expected to equal those in Switzerland in 2010. </p>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company entered the yerba mate category through its local partner Montevideo Refrescos SA in late 2009 in Venezuela, indicating growing interest in the regional flavour from international players. According to Euromonitor International's health and wellness database, yerba mate is far more popular than tea or coffee in much of South America and is slowly gathering critical mass as a global health and wellness beverage.</p>
<h2>Summary: Coca-Cola could be a big gun</h2>
<p>To summarise, the key story in 2009/2010 has been the continued rise of coffee pods, with North America starting to show growing interest in the category. Given the sheer size of fresh coffee sales in North America, the potential revenue prospects from a consumer switch could be tremendous over the medium term. Coffee companies and machine suppliers should prepare themselves for a potential boom. Hot drinks as staple and affordable drinks in most countries are still attractive to investors and suffered only slightly during the economic slowdown. Atlantic's acquisition of Droga Kolinska and Coca-Cola's entry into yerba mate show that major companies are interested in diversifying into hot drinks. Hence, the competitive environment will intensify and no company will have the luxury of being able to relax. </p>

"As long as there is fresh coffee packaging, there will be aluminium","Fresh coffee packaging is no doubt undergoing an important change: the continued boom in consumption of coffee pods over fresh ground or bean coffee, in particular in Europe, is generating rapid growth for flexible plastic at the expense of flexible aluminium/plastic.

In 2010, flexible plastic unit sales went up by 3% within Europe, while aluminium/plastic declined by 1%. With the price of aluminium laminates and technological progress in the barrier properties of flexible plastic, Euromonitor International questions the future of aluminium in this category. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Aluminium poses sourcing problems, which makes supply and usage rather expensive for fresh coffee packagers and brand owners. So when Douwe Egberts decided at the beginning of the review period to switch its packaging production for its Marcilla ground coffee from aluminium/plastic to 100% flexible plastic in Spain, the move was triggered by a need to renew their machinery, and an opportunity thereby to cut costs. But the economic recession which Europe has gone through since then, has also shown that consumers are not ready to sacrifice much on product quality: a switch from on-premise to home coffee consumption has certainly benefited coffee pods in flexible plastic packs; but when it comes to coffee beans and ground coffee, flexible aluminium/plastic remains the most widely used pack type in 2010. </p>
<p>The nature of fresh coffee, with attributes such as moisture and density of aroma, makes high preservation barriers necessary. Flexible plastic packs for coffee pods often only act as a marketing tool on the shelf; the capsules themselves, typically rigid plastic or aluminium minicups, are the ones protecting the content from light and oxygen. In fresh coffee, even if strong innovation activities have enabled noticeable improvements to flexible plastic's preservation properties, aluminium still stands much higher than flexible plastic can offer on its own. Latest trade interviews indicate that adopting a high quality flexible plastic material as a replacement to aluminium remains very expensive and inefficient; not only does it fail to match the preservation qualities of aluminium, but it is also not enough to lure consumers in: fresh coffee users still expect to see and feel the aluminium layer either outside, or inside when opening the pack.</p>
<p>But what about the problem of flexible aluminium/plastic's environmental impact? Flexible plastic is particularly light and can also be recycled or burnt in energy from waste facilities. By contrast, using two different materials (dual-layer) is heavier to transport and also means that sorting must be carried out before the recycling process can even be envisaged. Pyrolosis is an option for aluminium laminates, but facilities for this process are not yet common. Also, the first thing to consider is that when it comes to flexible packaging of any material, actual recycling rates also remain extremely low overall. Another element of answer could be that the real environmental footprint of a pack is very difficult to measure and that fresh coffee brand owners and packagers may benefit from a long term campaign to improve their image as more environmentally conscious, just as liquid carton (also multi-layer) advocates have managed to do.</p>

Sara Lee still has no permanent CEO following the mid-2010 resignation of Brenda Barnes after suffering a stroke, and in the meantime the company has moved ahead with a dramatic sell off of many of its diverse business units.   Sara Lee has divested its body care business to Unilever, its air care business to Procter &amp; Gamble, and in the last six months struck deals to sell the majority of its baked goods businesses to Grupo Bimbo, insecticides and shoe polish units to SC Johnson, and Australian cleaning products to Symex Holdings.  Current speculation has linked a number of private equity firms and Brazilian meat processor JBS to outright bids for the remainder of the company.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>But through all of this, Sara Lee's coffee business has remained a bright spot.  Sara Lee was the third largest coffee manufacturer in the world in 2010, behind Nestlé and Kraft, and continues to focus on key growth markets like Brazil.  To that end, in November 2010 Sara Lee announced it had paid US$60 million to acquire Café Damasco, a smaller Brazilian coffee company, in an attempt to build upon its leading market position in the country.</p>
<h2>A long term strategy of acquisition</h2>
<p>Brazil has a diverse and well established choice of coffees available to consumers, and also features the highest per capita coffee consumption in the Western Hemisphere at 4.4 kg per head in 2010 (US and Canada were closer to 3.0 kg/person).  Sara Lee held the first position within coffee sales in 2010 with a retail value share of 18%, largely unchanged from the year prior.  This position has been developed over time through a series of strategic moves to gain control of both national and popular regional coffee brands.</p>
<p>In 1998, Sara Lee began its entrance strategy in Brazil by acquiring Café do Ponto do Brasil SA.  Shortly after acquiring Café do Ponto, Sara Lee purchased Seleto SA Indústria e Comércio de Café, a small company in Sao Paulo. This was another strategic acquisition, as Seleto is a well-recognised brand in the country, while it also covers one of the largest coffee-consuming regions in Brazil.</p>
<p>In July 2000, Sara Lee continued its expansion strategy by purchasing Cia União dos Refinadores de Açúcar e Café, which included brands Pilão, União and Caboclo. This purchase first catapulted Sara Lee into the leading position in terms of retail sales of coffee in Brazil.  In 2008, Sara Lee signed an agreement to acquire Café Moka, a company with almost 100 years of history in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area. It also included a green coffee processing factory in Minas Gerais, which has provided impetus to the company's plans for sustainable coffee production.  In this light, the Café Damasco deal is the latest in a long tradition of growth through acquisitions for Sara Lee.</p>
<h2>Brazil a nation of local tastes</h2>
<p>But in addition to adding another popular regional brand to Sara Lee's portfolio, Café Damasco is a strategic geographical fit.  Sales of Brazilian coffee remain very fragmented and regionalized.  Although 46% of retail value share comes from the top four multinationals (Sara Lee, Nestlé, Strauss Group, and Melitta), more than 50% of the market is in the hands of small and medium companies.</p>
<p></p>

<p>% share<img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\6f9709a7-413d-475a-a86a-71715f754130.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<p>Sara Lee's Pilão and Caboclo still enjoy the bulk of their sales from the central metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but the Santa Clara brand from Strauss is a leader in the North and Northeast regions and 3 Corações is popular in the state of Minas Gerais.  Similarly, Café Damasco is a market leader in the South, and will help Sara Lee create a stronger foothold in this region as it seeks to find new areas of growth to compliment its core sales in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  Damasco also has a manufacturing facility in the Northeast, helping Sara Lee to gain production and distribution synergies for that region as well.</p>
<h2>Premium becomes the long term driver of growth</h2>
<p>The central strategy of Sara Lee in Brazil is not just predicated on the addition of popular regional brands, however, even if this has been a prominent feature of their moves to this point.  Instead, the company sees market position arising out of a shift towards more gourmet brands.  For example, the entry of specialist coffee shops in Brazil such as Starbucks forced Sara Lee to reformulate its coffee menu and the design of its kiosks, mainly located in shopping malls. Sara Lee has recently invested in the opening of new Café do Ponto coffee shops in states other than Sao Paulo. Café do Ponto is a more premium label traditionally sold in Sao Paulo. However, the company has initiated distribution of this brand in Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul with the support of the Café do Ponto coffee shops established in these areas.</p>
<p>The second leading coffee manufacturer in Brazil, Nestlé, has built its position through dominance of instant coffees and the launch of single serve home brewing systems like Nespresso.  Ultimately, Sara Lee hopes to better compete in these segments, and has already announced plans to launch its Senseo single serve coffee in Brazil.  Sara Lee also recently launched premium L'Or espresso pods for use with the Nespresso system in France, and could eventually bring these to Brazil as well.  </p>
<p>In order to introduce these kinds of new products to consumers in Brazil, Sara Lee will need a smooth method of production and distribution throughout all regions.  Café Damasco's network in the South and factory in the Northeast should help Sara Lee build this kind of national capability, and could prove more useful in the long term than the brand label itself.</p>
<h2>The changing Brazilian marketplace</h2>
<p>Euromonitor International expects a greater competition amongst leading companies in Brazil over the next five years as they seek to build more national networks. Strauss Group could acquire small regional companies in order to expand their sales covering the entire country while Nestlé will likely invest in new plants or expanding existing ones to produce its leading brand Nescafé to supply the growing demand for instant coffee. Sara Lee is expected to maintain its leading position, especially in the standard segments which still comprise the majority of coffee volume sales. But consolidation of smaller regional players is expected to continue and opportunities like Café Damasco will become less frequent.</p>
<p>Foodservice channels are also expected to continue to present the fastest growth,  increasing from 27% of total coffee volume sales in 2010 to 33% in 2015, in part with the opening of more specialist coffee shops and in part through the 52,000 independent bakeries that also sell coffee in the country.  This increased attention among consumers will help drive demand for more choice among the coffees they purchase for use at home and especially for more premium options.  Sara Lee and other international players must continue to act now to have the products and route to market in place if they hope to capitalize on this new demand.</p>

Refrigeration design in Western Europe: Anyone for coffee?,"Even during economic uncertainty, Western Europe boasts some of the highest value consumer appliances markets in the world. This briefing considers whether Western Europe's love affair with coffee might provide some inspiration for product innovation in major appliances at the top-end of the product portfolio range.","<p>Even during economic uncertainty, Western Europe boasts some of the highest value consumer appliances markets in the world. This briefing considers whether Western Europe's love affair with coffee might provide some inspiration for product innovation in major appliances at the top-end of the product portfolio range.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The newly published global briefing ""Refrigeration design in Western Europe: Anyone for coffee?"" is written as a thought piece designed to provoke discussion rather than firm recommendations. With sales of refrigeration appliances weathering the storm and with consumer preference for coffee so pronounced, this briefing considers the possible convergence of both into product design. It asks what criteria are required for this to even is a consideration, and whether any such product could ever be more than a niche in the high value markets of Western Europe. It looks at the potential for fridge freezers to incorporate coffee machines in multiple door formats. </p>
<h3>Key findings of the global briefing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Northern Europe most likely destination for coffee dispensing innovation: The Northern European markets have the greatest chance of this product flying. Coffee consumption, fridge freezer unit price and coffee machine formats combined favour these markets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Western Europe stagnant growth: The question is when will the market recover and where will the value add come within the major appliances market? Fridge freezers showed the fastest retail value growth in major appliances at over 3% in 2010.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee machines could help boost prices for refrigeration appliances: The potential for built-in coffee machines in fridge freezers does at present represent a niche opportunity to add potentially a higher values product to the portfolio or a marquee brand for higher tier spenders in Western European markets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Shrinking household sizes: As household sizes continue to shrink in Western Europe and appliance size plays a role in innovation, fridge freezer dispensing is expected to factor more into consumer purchasing decisions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Growth in multiple door fridge freezers: There were over half a million 3-door and side-by-side fridge freezers with dispensers sold in Western Europe in 2010, up 50% on 2005, despite the recessionary pressures of 2009 and 2010.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Value growth of coffee machines: There were over 25 million coffee machines sold in Western Europe in 2010. Retail sales of coffee machines in the region is worth an estimated €2.9 billion, representing growth of 63% over 2005, highlighting a shift to more premium formats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Fridge freezer strategic alliances: Within the top 10 Western European fridge freezer brands there are four that have no brand equity within coffee machines: these are Indesit, LG, Samsung and Liebherr.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee machine strategic alliances: There is only one coffee machine player in the top 10 that operates in major appliances, and refrigeration specifically, namely Bosch &amp; Siemens Hausgeräte GmbH, which is able to leverage both knowledge and brand equity.</li>
</ul>

Dunkin’ Donuts’ arrival marks new stage in India’s coffee wars,"With the announcement of a 500-store development agreement with local player Jubilant Foodworks,  Dunkin' Donuts has become the latest in a growing line of global players looking to build a presence in India's booming, fast-evolving coffee sector. ","<p>With the announcement of a 500-store development agreement with local player Jubilant Foodworks,  Dunkin' Donuts has become the latest in a growing line of global players looking to build a presence in India's booming, fast-evolving coffee sector. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>While doughnuts take centre stage for the chain in many Asian markets, the growing importance of coffee culture in India could result in a sales mix closer to that of the US, where pastries are a distant second behind Dunkin's iconic coffee. At the same time, it serves as further illustration of the kind of lightning evolution underway in India's foodservice coffee sector, with new developments seemingly taking place on a monthly basis. </p>
<h2>Dunkin' finds a powerful partner</h2>
<p>Reflecting the growing importance of strong local and regional partners, Dunkin' Donuts has chosen to team up with Jubilant Foodworks, master franchisee for Domino's Pizza in India, a brand which has seen sales expand fourfold over the last five years, surpassing US$100 million last year, while outlet numbers have tripled since 2004, with more than 300 Domino's Pizza outlets now in operation, according to company documents. Jubilant's size, resource base, and track record likely all played a role in determining Dunkin' Donuts' ambitious expansion programme, which calls for up to 500 Indian outlets within the next 15 years, a goal which, if anything, could prove conservative in a market where sales through chained fast food outlets are projected to expand by around 15 percent annually over the next five years, according to Euromonitor estimates. </p>
<p>While Dunkin' Donuts' baked goods selection would seem a natural fit in a market where sweets of all kinds are highly popular, the chain will likely gain significant traction as well with its coffee offerings, given the extraordinary growth in specialist coffee shops currently underway in India, with more than 1,500 new outlets expected to open over the next four years. At the same time, the coffee shops category has become increasingly segmented over the last 2-3 years, with upmarket outlets like Lavazza's Barista Creme joined by low-priced, grab-and-go options like Coffee Day Xpress kiosks. Though competition continues to intensify, Dunkin' outlets could take share with a combination of mid-priced coffee drinks and doughnuts, a relatively unique offer in a market where chained sweet baked goods operators remain few and far between. Likewise, the chain's menu potentially allows it to hit relatively low price points, a tactic which could drive sales among a broad consumer base. </p>
<h3>Could a mixed outlet strategy drive large-scale growth? </h3>
<p>At the same time, the sheer scale and diversity of the Indian market allows (or perhaps, requires) chains to experiment with a range of product and outlet strategies. While Dunkin' Donuts certainly has the capabilities to pursue a mid-priced product strategy, using small outlets in high-traffic areas to drive impulse sales throughout the day, it has also had significant success in other Asian markets by positioning itself as a destination, offering premium products and a place to socialise, study, or conduct business. In Thailand, the chain's fourth-largest market, for instance, outlets tend to average over 100 square meters in size, while doughnuts (which account for around 85-90% of sales) are promoted as premium indulgences for relatively affluent young people. A similar consumer segment can be found in India's major cities, long a focus for coffee chains like Cafe Coffee Day, Barista, and Costa Coffee. There is likely opportunity for Dunkin' to pursue a multi-pronged outlet strategy, using a combination of larger “destination” locations as well as smaller kiosk-style outlets to drive impulse sales. </p>
<p>Similarly, a diverse product strategy can be expected to pay dividends—while the demand for sweets in India is undoubtedly strong, Dunkin' Donuts has significant experience with savoury products in markets like China and South Korea, where fried, croquette-style savoury products are highly popular. A mix of sweets and savouries could help to expand the range of potential eating occasions Dunkin' outlets can serve, while also heading off coffee shop competitors, many of whom continue to make major investments in their food offerings. The entry of Dunkin' Donuts is expected to accelerate this process, with already-significant overlap between coffee shops, fast food, and even full-service dining expected to advance still further. </p>

Belarusian tea and coffee: Small yet resilient market with pockets of opportunity,"Euromonitor International discusses the state of the market, the competitive landscape and the demographic challenge faced by manufacturers.","<p>Euromonitor International discusses the state of the market, the competitive landscape and the demographic challenge faced by manufacturers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Coffee continues to be a good bet </h2>
<p>Despite the global economic slowdown, Belarus's off-trade value and volume sales of tea and coffee increased in 2010. As tea and coffee are established staple beverages, consumers continue to purchase them even during difficult economic times. Compared to other commercially available beverages, tea and coffee are regarded as affordable daily essentials.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International's latest research shows that off-trade volume sales of coffee increased by 2% in 2010, whilst off-trade value sales increased by 10% in US dollar terms. Fresh coffee was the most dynamic coffee category, with 3% volume and 12% value increases in the same year in terms of off-trade sales. The disparity between volume and value growth is indicative of a consumption trend towards high-quality, higher-priced products. Nevertheless, inflation played a role in the overall increases in coffee retail prices. As the coffee market is still growing, manufacturers managed to comfortably pass on rising costs to the consumer. According to Euromonitor International, the average retail price of coffee grew by around 8% in 2010, which was in line with inflation. The devaluation of the local currency and the nature of coffee, as a foreign import, put up retail prices. </p>
<p>Belarus has low per capita consumption levels of coffee, standing at 0.4kg, compared to an average of 1.4kg in Eastern Europe as a whole. In Belarus's rural areas, per capita consumption is much lower than the national average. A growing market like Belarus can absorb price increases, and the effect of price increases on off-trade volume sales is therefore minimal. This is an encouraging sign for both existing coffee players and those considering entering the market. Euromonitor International forecasts that instant coffee will see a net increase of US$17 million during 2010-2015; 3-in-1 instant coffee in particular will have good growth potential as it is convenient to prepare, thus fitting well with modern, urban lifestyles. </p>
<p>In terms of competitive landscape, multinationals dominate coffee sales in Belarus, with Nestlé, Kraft, Orimi and Tchibo accounting for a combined 66% share of retail value sales in 2010. IkarTime is the only domestic player, holding a 3% value share. Nestlé continued to maintain its leadership in coffee overall, with sales underpinned by its dominance of instant coffee. During difficult economic times, marketing activities and new product introductions are less frequent than in a boom period. Many manufacturers thus reduced their expenditure on above-the-line advertising and replaced it with in-store promotional activities to retain consumers. However, armed with strong financial capabilities, Nestlé notably continued with the same level of marketing activities as before in 2010. </p>
<p>The Russian-based company Orimi leads fresh coffee and managed to make value share gains during 2007-2010, making it the fastest-growing company in fresh coffee in the same period. In 2009-2010, Orimi introduced Jardin fresh coffee to Belarus, supported by TV advertising. Jardin is positioned as a good-quality product, although it is priced as mid-range. As fresh coffee is predicted to outperform the overall coffee market in terms of value growth during 2010-2015, sales of Jardin stand a good chance of overtaking Paulig and Jacobs in the short to medium term. </p>

<h3>Greenfield outperforms Unilever in tea </h3>
<p>Belarus has an established tea market, with off-trade value sales of tea standing at US$86 million in 2010 and total growth of 26% recorded in 2005-2010. Whilst coffee tends to only be consumed by younger consumers, the majority of the population in Belarus drinks tea regularly. Black tea is traditionally popular among consumers of all age groups and in both rural and urban areas. Sophisticated, young, urban consumers, who are open to experimenting, prefer black speciality tea, while rural and elderly consumers prefer standard black tea. Whilst demand for tea bags continues to increase amongst more affluent, busy urban consumers, lower-income consumers prefer cheaper loose tea. Belarus's growing number of health-conscious consumers tends to prefer green or fruit/herbal tea products and products made from natural additives as opposed to artificial ingredients. Manufacturers need to take these consumption patterns and trends into account when they enter Belarus and/or introduce new products or flavours. </p>
<p>During the economic slowdown, off-trade sales of tea continued to grow in terms of US dollars, with black standard tea bags being the main growth driver. Increased consumption of tea bags is down to the changed perception of tea bags. Previously, tea bags were generally considered to be of poor quality and packed with substandard ingredients. However, the quality of tea bags has improved and consumers' perceptions and purchasing attitudes towards tea bags are also becoming more favourable. Additionally, consumers are living a busier lifestyle and showing a tendency towards more convenient food and beverages. Euromonitor International expects this consumption trend to continue during the next few years, which is encouraging news for major black tea companies such as Unilever, Greenfield Tea Ltd and Ahmad Tea London Ltd. Green tea and fruit/herbal tea meanwhile remain niche categories that are only experiencing marginal growth, mainly due to increased interest amongst urban consumers. </p>
<p>In terms of the competitive landscape, Greenfield Tea Ltd leads tea sales in Belarus, with year-on-year share gains and a 17% overall value share in 2010. 2009 saw Greenfield tea overtake Unilever to claim the leading position, leaving Unilever trailing behind Greenfield with a 15% value share in 2010. During 2008-2010, Greenfield's strength was underpinned by its large presence in black tea, with the company growing its value share from 5% to 18% during the 2005-2010 period. In terms of Belarusian production of tea, there are two local companies, Macbor UP, producer of the Milord brand, and Minskaya Ovoshchnaya Fabrica KUP, which specialises in fruit/herbal tea mixes. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International's latest research shows that supermarkets/hypermarkets and discounters are gaining retail volume share within tea at the expense of small grocery retailers. This trend is expected to continue; therefore, it is crucial for manufacturers to target mainstream retail outlets, particularly the growing supermarkets/hypermarkets channel, if their products are to be well stocked in-store. </p>

<h2>Russian influence</h2>
<p>Belarus remains largely reliant on Russia for its imports and it has numerous business links with Russia. Many international companies are based in Russia's major cities and have set up packing facilities there to serve Russia's neighbours. </p>
<p>Belarusian and Russian are both official languages in Belarus, but Russian is the dominant language, with the share of Russian speakers slowly rising. By 2030, 73% of all Belarusians will speak Russian. According to Belarus's national census figures, two-thirds of all residents speak Russian at home. Even among ethnic Belarusians, almost 60% speak Russian at home. This demographic situation means that it is possible to use Russian on product packaging and in product campaigns. Hot drinks manufacturers can therefore develop advertising campaigns for both Russia and Russian-speaking nations such as Belarus. </p>
<p>The downward trend in the Belarusian population represents a demographic challenge for fmcg companies. It is forecast that, by 2030, the total population will be 12% lower than at its peak recorded in 1993. The pool of potential workers (15-64-year-olds) is expected to drop by 962,000 during 2010-2030. The ageing and shrinking of the population means that it may be hard to increase volume sales. Increasing value sales and driving value growth appears to be the way forward in the long term. </p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Starbucks eyes a growth segment</h2>
<p> Starbucks is touted as bringing premium coffee beverages to the forefront of American culture and is a pioneer in the specialist coffee arena. However, due to the economic recession and shifts in consumer spending, the company in recent years has experienced increased competition from companies such as Dunkin' Donuts, Caribou Coffee and the 2009 introduction of the McCafé line from McDonald's. Over the past few years Starbucks has tried to counter this competition by looking for revenue streams beyond its traditional in-store offerings.  </p>
<p>Various trials with bottled drinks and breakfast foods met with mixed success, until the 2009 launch of Via Ready Brew, the company's premium instant coffee that surpassed $100 million in sales during its first year.  The rapid success of Via coincided with the company's announcement of a new strategy to greatly expand its grocery sales as a complimentary platform to its retail stores.  This ultimately led to the breakup with Kraft Foods as a distributor and even to a redesigned logo removing “coffee” from the Starbucks name, all with an eye towards building a more varied product lineup. </p>
<p>With Starbucks branded K-Cups, Starbucks will immediately gain access to another high growth product segment in coffee pods that could become a cornerstone of this new grocery strategy along with Via.  Starbucks had been an early adopter of pod technology through its Tassimo offerings, but Tassimo and Senseo were launched during a period when coffee pods systems struggled to catch on with consumers in the mid-2000s.  Though pods have been ubiquitous for a number of years in offices, it is only in 2009-2010 that they have seen great success in the retail market, nearly doubling in sales each year to surpass US$500 million in 2010.  This period has coincided with the rise to prominence of the Keurig and Nespresso systems in the US, both seen by consumers as being of slightly higher quality.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">US Retail Sales of Coffee Pods</h4>
<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\1ca16e01-e8cd-415c-b829-7c33295e0893.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenotes"">Note: Excludes office and institutional sales</p>
<p>The first deal Starbucks announced following its break from Kraft was with Courtesy Products, to bring single serve coffee to more than 500,000 hotels throughout the country.  But this deal with Green Mountain indicates a much greater commitment to the single serve concept.  The greatest barrier to sales is adoption of the expensive Keurig machines, which typically are in the US$100 range and can still seem confusing to consumers used to traditional drip coffee makers.  Starbucks has announced that both the pods and machines will be sold in its stores starting in early 2012, which should help them gain visibility and reach consumers already loyal to the Starbucks brand.</p>
<h2>Green Mountain finds the jewel it needed</h2>
<p>Although the company was not responsible for the first coffee/tea pods, Green Mountain was able to find success by combining its pod technology with a stable of several popular licensed regional coffee brands. This allows consumers to already have a familiar product to try although they may be new to the single serve pod machine brewing process. In recent years the company sought greater control by buying out these licensed manufacturers, including Tully's, Timothy's and Diedrich, and completing the task in 2010 with the purchase of Canada's Van Houtte.  At the same time, new licensing deals with national brands like Caribou, Folgers, and Celestial Seasonings were struck, at a time when Green Mountain made a push into national grocery chains.</p>
<p>Just two weeks prior to the Starbucks announcement, Green Mountain signed a deal for Dunkin Donuts pods to be licensed and sold in Dunkin Donuts outlets starting in fall 2011.  With these two deals, Green Mountain now has three of the top five selling US coffee brands on its system.  This should help attract some of the many customers loyal to these brands who may have been reluctant to purchase a pod coffee machine in the past.  </p>
<p>Though all pod coffees can perhaps be considered premium due to their higher cost, Starbucks is the first nationally recognized super premium brand to be used with K-Cups, and in fact has this exclusivity built into their agreement.  This will give Green Mountain its first direct competitor to Nestlé's Nespresso pod system, which has become the clear premium pod leader in international markets and also has started to see some momentum in the US.  Nespresso seems to have emerged as the most serious long term threat to Green Mountain's top position in pod sales.  Nespresso does not have the same level of distribution as K-Cups, nor the same brand recognition as Starbucks in the US though, and this new arrangement should solidify Green Mountain's lead.</p>
<h2>Shifting landscape creates long odds for some competitors</h2>
<p>The Starbucks deal immediately adversely impacts the major US pod competitors.  Kraft's Tassimo system, which had been positioned as a more premium quality system due to its inclusion of dairy components to make specific blended coffee drinks, immediately loses its most prominent premium brand and perhaps takes the most direct hit.  Senseo from Sara Lee, Nespresso from Nestlé, and Flavia from Mars all now face a much more formidable competitor at the top.  But all of these companies also have the bulk of their sales in other product segments, so the overall health of their business is not at stake.</p>
<h2>Peet's situation</h2>
<p>One of the hardest hit competitors may be one who is not a big player in coffee pods but was looking to become one: Peet's Coffee.  Peet's is a premium coffee specialist chain that is the chief competitor to Starbucks in the Western states.  Like Starbucks, they began to struggle during the recession years as the pace of outlet expansion slowed.  Their stated strategy was to move into the coffee pods segment, and in 2010 Peet's made an unsuccessful bid for Diedrich Coffee, the primary K-Cup manufacturer in the Western region.  Later they tried to work out a licensing deal with Green Mountain, though now this seems unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>As a result of this tenuous position, reports surfaced in late March that Peet's was looking to sell itself to Starbucks.  Such a deal would give Starbucks some much needed immediate access to grocery distribution in the region, but there is also quite a bit of overlap in Starbucks and Peet's locations, with many within one block of each other in places like California.  The Peet's premium brand is also a direct competitor to Starbucks and not a lower-priced complimentary fit like Seattle's Best was when the company acquired it in 2003.  While barriers seem to exist for such a merger, it does seem likely that Peet's will be the first to take a new direction in light of the Starbucks-Green Mountain partnership.  With the strength this alliance represents, they may not be the last.</p>

Peet’s Situation May Drive Change in the US Coffee Market,"In a recent article Euromonitor identified that recent changes in the US coffee market may have a significant negative impact on Peet's, a regional super-premium fresh coffee competitor.  This article will examine a potential option for Peet's and the broader impact on the US fresh coffee market.","<p>In a recent article Euromonitor identified that recent changes in the US coffee market may have a significant negative impact on Peet's, a regional super-premium fresh coffee competitor.  This article will examine a potential option for Peet's and the broader impact on the US fresh coffee market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>The changes</h2>
<p>The first development is Starbucks taking direct control of the distribution of its products in retail.  Short-term this will increase Starbucks profitability since they no longer need to share revenue with Kraft.  Longer-term this should benefit new product introductions as the new distribution network is likely to pay more attention to executing new product introductions than would Kraft.  However, if the transition is not executed flawlessly, there may be some short-term execution issues at retail.</p>
<p>The second development is Starbucks reaching an agreement to supply Green Mountain with a super-premium Starbucks branded pod.  This will most likely lock-up Keurig as the premier pod system in the US.   Green Mountain's success to date is primarily attributable to the office market .  They are now well-positioned to make a push into the home with distribution through Starbucks stores and supermarkets.  However, it is not clear that there will be sufficient demand for pods in the home market to generate enough volume to maintain pod distribution in supermarkets.</p>
<p>These two events likely position Starbucks as the preeminent super-premium brand.  But Peet's, a regional super-premium competitor of Starbucks, is likely to be threatened by Starbucks' ascendancy.</p>
<h2>What could Peet's do?</h2>
<p>At this point, before their market position further erodes, Peet's best move may be to sell themselves.  Fortunately for Peet's, there is likely to be an abundance of companies that are interested.  It would be advantageous to both parties to complete a deal as quickly as possible while Starbucks is integrating into a new distribution system.  </p>
<p>The list of companies that could benefit from incorporating the Peet's brand into their portfolio includes Kraft, Smucker, Sara Lee, Nestle and Tata Global Beverages.  For all of these companies there may be significantly increased volume opportunity from expanding Peet's distribution in retail beyond the West Coast.  Starbucks is most vulnerable to being out-executed in supermarkets by competition when they are being integrated into a new distribution system.  However, the window of opportunity is likely to be small for Starbucks' competition.</p>
<p>For Kraft, the advantage of owning Peet's is it would directly replace Starbucks with a super-premium brand.  The major issue is finding the financial resources after just completing the Cadbury mega-deal.</p>
<p>Although Smucker distributes Dunkin Donuts fresh coffee, the brand's strength is primarily in the East.  Peet's western strength is complimentary.  The issue is that expanding Peet's distribution beyond the West is likely to somewhat cannibalize Dunkin Donuts fresh coffee.</p>
<p> Sara Lee is the #2 company globally in 2010 with an 7.7% value share (trailing only Kraft which had a 10.9% share).  They have a very small presence in the US since they sold most of their US coffee business to Segafredo Zanetti SpA in 2004.  The only brand remaining in the US is Senseo (a pod brand with a very minor share).  However, since then the coffee unit has been spun-off as a separate business.  The issue is that, due to its limited distribution, Peet's may not be the best way to re-start their US business.</p>
<p>Nestle competes in super-premium coffee with their Nespresso brand.  Nespresso does not have the strength in the US that it has in Europe.  In fact, it looks like Green Mountain, particularly in light of the recent partnership with Starbucks, will be very strong competition for Nespresso.  Peet's may be a way for Nestle to enter the super-premium segment in the US and hedge its bets on single serve fresh coffee.  The issue for Nestle is that they are in the instant coffee and pod market.  Peet's would be their first fresh bagged coffee brand globally.</p>
<p>The best fit for Peet's may be with Tata Global Beverages.  Tata is currently the #4 player in the US market where their Eight O'Clock brand had a 3.9% value share of Fresh Coffee in 2010.  Eight O'Clock is standard priced and distributed primarily in the East.  Peet's is very complimentary.  Additionally, Tata has expressed a desire to expand its global presence and Peet's looks like a rare opportunity.  </p>
<p>The price for Peet's may be attractive since they need to complete a deal before their competitive position erodes.  Potential suitors may only want a deal if the price is right.  The coffee market in the US may have been a little sleepy in the past but it now appears to be waking-up.</p>

Strategic Alliances in Coffee: The Nespresso Effect,"March saw Starbucks Corp announce the strategic alliance agreement with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR). The deal brings together the second largest value fresh coffee brand in the US with the market leader in coffee pod sales.  Euromonitor International explains the terms of the latest deal, evaluates potential of a similar partnership outside North America and asks if strategic alliances are now fundamental to drive market share in developed markets.","<p>March saw Starbucks Corp announce the strategic alliance agreement with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc.

<h3>GMCR Seeks to Boost Sales of its Pod Coffee Machines</h3>
<p>Under the agreement the Seattle chain will sell both Starbucks and Tazo branded pods for the Keurig K-Cup single cup brewing system. Starbucks K-Cup pods and Keurig machines will be sold through Starbucks stores, with Starbucks pods becoming available through Green Mountain's and Starbucks' web sites in 2012. The companies are planning to make the K-Cup pods widely available through grocery retailers, mass merchants and department stores throughout North America from autumn 2011.</p>
<p>By adding Starbucks to a K-Cup line up, which already includes Folgers and Twinings, GMCR expects to boost sales of its Keurig coffee machines over the medium term, especially as Starbucks will offer a wider distribution footprint. GMCR's corporate aim is clearly to increase market share within the high value pod coffee machines segment and no doubt this is why the company has been active in both mergers and acquisitions (Timothy's 2009, Tully's 2008) and strategic alliances.</p>
<h3>What's at Stake for GMCR in US</h3>
<p>GMCR entered the coffee machine market with the acquisition of Keurig, with whom GMCR had a long partnership. Keurig coffee machines are manufactured in China via an OEM and distributed through the company's own capillary supply network across North America. In an effort to consolidate distribution and move brands into new territories, the company has spent much of 2009 and 2010 buying out its licensees to gain full control of the manufacturing of its K-Cups. In this context the acquisition of Timothy's and Tully's bolstered GMCR logistic capabilities. Its strategy has proved successful, as Keurig has been the fastest unit volume growth coffee machine brand in the US consistently over 2005-2010.</p>
<p>In June 2009, GMCR entered into partnership with Jarden's Mr Coffee brand in order to create Mr Coffee Single-Cup coffee machines for the US and Canada retail market. These coffee machines utilise Keurig's technology along with Mr Coffee's brand equity, which held the leading retail brand volume share in coffee machines in 2009 at 37%. Similarly, in June 2009 Conair Corp, through its Cuisinart brand, also partnered with GMCR to produce single-cup coffee machines, launched in the spring of 2010. </p>
<p>The inclusion of the Starbucks brand could add yet another dimension to previous alliances and aid further growth, since Starbucks is the second consumer food service brand in US and synonymous in North America for a premium coffee experience. Furthermore, under the agreement, GMCR will also be able leverage Starbucks' extensive retail outlet network as, in addition to the manufacturer's current retail locations, Keurig coffee machines will be sold in the 11,700 Starbucks shops.  In the context of a very dynamic  and potentially volatile competitive scenario, GMCR crucially protected itself from the possibility that Starbucks would develop its own machines or partner with one of its rivals, as the Seattle company had done previously with the agreement with Tassimo (BSH). </p>

<h3>Starbucks Seeking to Expand Sales of At-Home Offer</h3>
<p>Starbucks had previously licensed its pods to Bosch Tassimo through an agreement with Kraft Foods Inc. During the twelve years partnership with Kraft, Starbucks had handled product launches and sales through its branded retail outlets, but has relied on the distribution strength of licensing partners for sales through retail, including Kraft for Starbucks, Seattle's Best coffees and Tazo teas.</p>
<p>Starbucks is not new to sales of premium coffee machines either. Currently Starbucks in US sells Saeco and De'Longhi premium coffee machines, and Kitchen Aid coffee grinders. It remains to be seen how the agreement with GMCR will impact the rest of Starbucks coffee machine portfolio within its stores. </p>
<p>Nevertheless what is new about this deal is that it coincides with the rise to prominence of the Keurig K-Cups espresso system. By launching the Starbucks branded K-Cups, the company will be gaining access to the high growth hard coffee pods segment, this time on the back of the fifth largest US coffee machine brand by retail volume sales.</p>
<h3>The Limits of the Agreement</h3>
<p>Both companies however face potential risks in seeking growth in the premium segment. Despite the recent success of hard pods coffee machines, US consumers are still used to low unit price traditional filter coffee makers and the effects of the recession made the US consumer base even more frugal. Although so far the competition from the premium-end Nespresso espresso machines has not eroded the share of the leading coffee machine players, it is indeed becoming more and more aggressive and might prove a tougher opponent over the long run, especially in the core urban centres in the US.</p>
<p>The success of Nespresso has been built on the back of the increasing popularity of the Italian style short espresso culture, which has become synonymous for a premium coffee experience. In this sense the K-Cup 4oz to 12oz serving sizes (118 ml to 355 ml) perfectly cater to traditional North American consumer preferences but it is not likely to succeed outside the region. Very likely this is one reason why the deal with GMCR covers only US, meaning that Starbucks is free to partner in other countries with regional market leaders.</p>
<h3>Could Starbucks Pods Success Lie Outside the US?</h3>
<p> Indeed outside North America, Western Europe represents the most important market for hard pods coffee machines. The Western European market for fresh coffee in 2010 was worth $13bn in retail value terms, nearly double the size of the US market, accounting for over a third of the global retail value sales in the same year. In this context appliances players are all, in a way or another, trying to tap into the fast growing and highly valuable hard pods coffee machines segment. On the one hand, small appliances manufacturers are rushing to patent their closed coffee brewing systems, twinning with major fresh coffee brands. On the other one, major appliances manufacturers are trying to drive sales of their designer lines incorporating pods coffee machines in their built-in portfolio. Could this represent an opportunity for Starbucks or GMCR?</p>
<p>For Starbucks, a venture in Western Europe would certainly be more difficult than in US. The European market for pods coffee machines is fiercely competitive and already sees premium coffee brands such as Senseo,  Nespresso, Tassimo and Lavazza, successfully delivering what consumers perceive as a premium coffee experience.   </p>
<p>Crucially in Europe Starbucks cannot leverage the same brand recognition it enjoys in the US. When it comes to retail sales, the volume that the brand generates is still negligible. Despite ranking sixth within the chained cafés/bar in Western Europe, Starbucks brand is still associated more with flavoured coffees and “frappucinos” than with espresso or premium coffee.</p>
<p>In terms of positioning, Starbucks coffee is not perceived as premium by the majority of Western Europe consumers. Starbucks would require a huge marketing effort to convince European consumers to prefer its American coffee brand over the hugely popular Nespresso or the established Italian fine coffee trademarks. Additionally, European coffee machines manufacturers looking to collaborate with premium fresh coffee producers might be reluctant to partner with a mid-tier brand such as Starbucks to boost sales of their added value coffee machines. For a strategic alliance in Europe to work, the retail unit price of Starbucks pods and of the coffee machines would have to be less than its premium competitors, therefore tapping into the mass market.</p>
<p>To enter the European market GMCR would also have to change its current K-Cup system to cater for the different European coffee preferences. Additionally in Europe the company could not count on the same capillary distribution network that it has in US. However GMCR might look to extend its aggressive acquisition-led strategy into Western Europe in the future. </p>

<h3>What the Future Holds</h3>
<p>Although it is yet to be seen if the deal will reshape the competitive landscape within the North American coffee machines market, the Starbucks and GMCR agreement shines a spotlight on coffee pods in the region, indicating that after a tentative decade, manufacturers expect the market for pod coffee machines to finally flourish, growing even further in the mid-to-long-term. Nevertheless the difficulties that Nespresso encountered in penetrating the US market as opposed to the remarkable success of Keurig's K-Cups system is an indication that the perception of premium coffee in the US is very different from the one in Western Europe. Similarly it would be very difficult for both North American companies to enter the premium European market, already led by established premium brands.</p>

Exponential Growth Goes on For South Korean Coffee Shops,"Even by the lofty standards of the category, growth in specialist coffee shops in South Korea has been impressive, with sales nearly doubling since 2007. ","<p>Even by the lofty standards of the category, growth in specialist coffee shops in South Korea has been impressive, with sales nearly doubling since 2007. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Long an instant coffee culture, with vending machines accounting for a large percentage of sales, the specialist coffee shops category has reached critical mass in South Korea virtually overnight, with demand surging among young Koreans for good-quality coffee served in a modern, comfortable environment. While Starbucks leads the way, it has been joined by a growing cohort of aggressive local players, all of whom have looked to profit from a trend which has, as others have before it, achieved mass scale among South Korean consumers at lightning speed. </p>
<h2>Starbucks-style coffee shops in, old-school cafes out</h2>
<p>Coffee consumption is nothing new in South Korea—instant coffee has long been highly popular, and remains the preferred choice for home coffee consumption, while traditional cafes, or dabang, gained prominence in the 1960's and 70's as a place to sip (usually instant) coffee and listen to popular music, not unlike Japan's kissaten. What's more, vending machines remain a popular means of coffee consumption, and are found throughout major cities. In the last 3-4 years, however, modern specialist coffee shops have exploded in popularity, with sales expected to surpass US$1.4 billion (1.5 trillion won) in 2011. As it has in other countries, Starbucks has served as a key catalyst of this trend, introducing many Koreans, particularly young people, to the virtues of high-quality drip coffee and espresso drinks. The American chain remains the leading specialist coffee shop chain in South Korea, with estimated 2010 sales of US$230 million (250 billion won), while average annual sales growth has remained in the double-digits since the chain's arrival. </p>
<p>Yet the Korean coffee boom goes beyond just a Starbucks-driven fad in a market where consumer trends can reach critical mass and then vanish in a matter of months. Specialist coffee shops fill an important niche in a country where foodservice outlets remain the primary choice for entertaining, socialising, and study, particularly for young people, in a market where living spaces tend to be quite small. Free wi-fi also serves as a minor, yet real inducement in a country with one of the highest rates of PC ownership and broadband penetration in the world. What's more, coffee shops are not new in South Korea—the aforementioned dabang operate with a business model similar to specialist coffee shops, offering coffee at a (relatively) premium price in exchange for unlimited to time to socialise or study. The key difference between the two categories comes in the type of coffee served—dabang often serve instant coffee—as well as clientele, with dabang consumers tending to skew significantly older. </p>
<h3>Fierce competition here to stay </h3>
<p>Indicating the trend has grown well beyond the fad stage, specialist coffee shops have occupied a place in South Korean pop culture for some time—the television drama “1st Shop of Coffee Prince,” about the romance between a young heir to a coffee fortune and a barista at a coffee shop he owns, was one of the highest-rated Korean television programs during its one-season run in 2007. Since then, the category has only grown, with Starbucks now facing fierce competition from local players like Angel-in-us, Caffe Bene, Ediya Espresso, and Holly's. Also telling is the growing presence of major Korean retail and foodservice players—Starbucks outlets are operated as part of a joint venture with department store chain Shinsegae, while local chain Angel-in-us is a subsidiary or retail/foodservice giant Lotte Group. Indeed, while Starbucks still leads in sales terms, it has fallen to third in outlets, behind both Angel-in-us and Caffe Bene—as seen in other foodservice categories, like fast food, local Korean players have pursued extremely aggressive strategies in what has proven to be a highly profitable category, both in terms of securing the best outlet sites and in new product development, with Angel-in-us rolling out a spate of Korean-influenced food items and coffee alternatives like its “Grain Latte,” a hot breakfast beverage made from domestically-sourced grain. Price competition has also come to the fore, with Ediya Espresso making strong gains in the recession year of 2009 with a product offering priced on average around 30% lower than Starbucks and other chains. </p>
<p>While expansion in specialist coffee shops is expected to continue going forward, the window for new entrants to make a splash in the category could be closing fast. Sales are expected to surpass US$9 billion (10 trillion won) by 2015, with entrenched players expected to steadily add to their share, supported in most cases by the capital and real estate know-how of major retail and foodservice conglomerates. For any chain looking to make headway in South Korea, close collaboration with a well-funded local partner is and will remain crucial. Nor is the competitive environment expected to become any easier going forward—McDonald's has already introduced its McCafe line in South Korea, with other fast food chains expected to follow suit as coffee shops further encroach on the market for young people looking for places to socialise, study, and relax. </p>

Kraft Enters the Premium Coffee Market in North America,"With Starbucks taking over responsibility for distributing their namesake fresh packaged coffee in retail, Kraft will experience a decline in revenue.  Obviously Kraft is looking to make-up this loss.  Recently they announced that they will distribute their Gevalia brand in US retail.  The question is:  Is Kraft serious about seriously challenging Starbucks for a leadership position in premium coffee or is the company just trying to keep a presence in the high end of the category?","<p>With Starbucks taking over responsibility for distributing their namesake fresh packaged coffee in retail, Kraft will experience a decline in revenue.  Obviously Kraft is looking to make-up this loss.  Recently they announced that they will distribute their Gevalia brand in US retail.  The question is:  Is Kraft serious about seriously challenging Starbucks for a leadership position in premium coffee or is the company just trying to keep a presence in the high end of the category?</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Kraft's situation</h2>
<p>Kraft built Starbucks packaged coffee into the #3 brand in retail value in the US.  In 2010 Starbucks fresh coffee distributed by Kraft in retail had a 5.4% value share of fresh coffee, trailing only Folgers with a 12.3% retail value share and Maxwell House with a 7.5% retail value share.  This amounted to over US$400 million in retail sales in 2010 for Starbucks fresh coffee.  This is a lot of retail revenue to make up and it is unlikely Maxwell House can do the job.</p>
<p>The average retail price of Maxwell House in 2010 was US$8 per kilogram vs. US$29 per kilogram for Starbucks.  Clearly Maxwell House and Starbucks are purchased by consumers to meet different needs.  So Kraft not only has a lot of revenue to make up, the company also has a gap in their portfolio in meeting consumer needs in the fresh coffee category.</p>
<p>This sounds like a large amount of retail sales but Kraft is a very large company so it's important to put US$400 million in perspective.  This represents less than 6% of Kraft's global coffee retail value in 2010 and under  1% of Kraft's global retail sales (when including Cadbury).  Even looking at only North America, Starbucks fresh coffee distributed by Kraft is just 2% of the retail value of all products sold by Kraft.   Additionally, Kraft has five brands that generate over US$1 billion in retail value annually.  </p>
<p>Kraft not only has a lot of brands to choose from to make up the lost sales from Starbucks, the company also has other resources.  Kraft is the largest food company in North America. This gives Kraft leverage with retailers that Starbucks will not be able to duplicate. Additionally, Kraft has a direct sales force that helps in retail execution.   Kraft also has an impressive advertising and consumer promotion budget to support its vast array of brands.  The issue for Kraft is not only making up lost revenue but also strategic management of its brand portfolio.</p>
<h2>The case for and against Gevalia</h2>
<p>Gevalia is a premium priced brand that has been around for a long time.  However, currently it is only sold direct to the consumer.  The brand has limited awareness and usage is in a very limited population.  It will be competing against both Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.</p>
<p>With the right amount of attention, Kraft's sales force could achieve impressive retail distribution of Gevalia in a short amount of time.  Also, Kraft could spend generously on advertising and consumer promotion to generate awareness and give Gevalia a solid brand image.  Kraft could even do extensive sampling of Gevalia so consumers could judge its quality vs. its better known competitors.</p>
<p>However, for Kraft to do all this will take resources and attention away from its other, well established, brands.  If Kraft provided Gevalia with limited advertising and sales support, then distribution and sales would build much more slowly.</p>
<h2>So which road will Kraft choose?</h2>
<p>We will know the course Kraft has chosen pretty quickly.  If Gevalia builds national retail distribution quickly, then look for a well-funded advertising and consumer promotion campaign about three months after distribution begins.  If retail distribution builds slowly, then we will see Kraft turn to other brands in its portfolio to generate the sales lost from Starbucks.  While Kraft could spend the money to make Gevalia a success, there are probably more efficient ways to strategically grow their corporate portfolio of brands in North America.  Coffee does not need to be their only focus.</p>

Desire For Affordable Luxury Creating Premium Shift in Polish Coffee,"In 2010, the coffee culture became increasingly widespread and sophisticated in Poland. The aspiring generation of 30-40-year-old consumers continued to show an appetite for affordable luxury items. This, in turn, stimulated the demand for premium positioned coffees.

The aspiring generation of 30-40-year-old consumers continued to show an appetite for affordable luxury items. This, in turn, stimulated the demand for premium positioned coffees. In particular, fresh coffee beans, coffee pods, and specialist coffee shops benefited from the growing coffee culture in Poland. With the domestic economy offering resistance to the financial crisis (GDP growth is projected at 4% or higher through 2012), consumers continue to seek out coffee and aspirational products in general.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>New launches drive attention towards high quality coffees</h2>
<p>Fresh coffee beans recorded the fastest retail value sales growth in coffee in 2010 with a 17% increase. The upper-premium segment within fresh coffee beans is developing fast. Very high-priced coffee products in exclusive packaging are attractive to consumers, while the growing popularity of coffee machines is also boosting sales of fresh coffee beans. Nestlé's Nespresso and Tchibo's Caffisimo are examples of coffee concepts benefiting from the rapidly growing popularity of coffee pods in Poland. </p>
<p>Premium positioned Carte Noire and Douwe Egberts entered Poland in 2009, while numerous new product launches engaged consumers in 2010. Tchibo Exclusive 100% Arabica and Tchibo Espresso in two variants (Milano-Style and Sicilia-Style), and the extension of Jacobs Krönung with an espresso option are examples of the premiumisation trend in coffee. The increasing sophistication of both consumers and flavour options was behind the launch of Nescafé Gold All'Italiana. The domestic player Mokate Sp zoo rolled-out premium fresh ground coffee under Mokate tostato all'Italiana. Moreover, the company intensified its efforts through Global Coffee Group to market upper-premium coffee products. </p>
<h2>Foodservice coffee sales help expand coffee usage occasions </h2>
<p>Although consumer foodservice in Poland suffered declines in volume and value terms in 2010, coffee consumption enjoyed an upward trend in the on-trade channel. Coffee recorded faster volume sales growth in the foodservice channel than in the retail channel throughout the past five years. The Westernisation trend was an important contributor to the growing demand for coffee in on-trade establishments, with specialist coffee shops enjoy rising popularity. “Coffee to go” has become a popular concept among consumers in big cities. McDonald's launched the McCafé concept and strongly expanded its coffee offerings in the last few years.  However, the growth in foodservice is derived from a low sales base. Per capita spending within Polish on-trade establishments is amongst the lowest in Europe. </p>
<p>The number of specialist coffee shops in Poland soared from 138 in 2004 to 385 in 2009. The boom in specialist coffee shops has helped to develop the tastes of Polish consumers. As a result, more consumers are turning to premium coffee products. Coffee drinkers have started to differentiate between Robusta and Arabica beans. Moreover, the growing numbers of coffee aficionados are more aware of the differences between coffee beans from various regions. </p>
<h2>Multinationals are first to innovate..</h2>
<p>Because multinationals are able to realise important economies of scale in terms of coffee bean, logistics, and production costs, they have a significant advantage in the supply chain over smaller domestic rivals. Domestic manufacturers tend to follow the concepts and strategies of multinational players. Only Mokate makes major efforts to compete with multinationals with innovative ideas, for example using novel ingredients such as sea algae. Meanwhile, some domestic companies like Zas-Pol, Instanta, and Posti concentrate on manufacturing for retail chains.</p>
<p>Due to the higher prices of premium coffee, brand owners offered such products in smaller pack sizes. For example, Tchibo Gold Selection Crema brand was introduced in 90g and 180g glass jars, compared to commonly applied 100g and 200g versions. These smaller pack sizes went largely unnoticed by the average consumer, and allowed manufacturers to offer premium products at similar prices to standard products. This provided an additional incentive for consumers to purchase premium coffee in small packs, even though they were not getting the same deal on a price per unit basis.</p>
<h2>..But domestics still have an opportunity</h2>
<p>Polish companies will have to be able to react quicker to consumer trends by bringing out new products that answer changing consumer demands. However, smaller companies often lack the research and development budgets necessary to create new product developments, which might only survive in the market for a couple of years. Local firms will typically wait for a multinational to launch and after a few years introduce similar products but at prices 10-15% lower. </p>
<p>Some Polish players will look for niches in order to remain competitive. Domestic companies are also expected to increase their production of private label products. However, other local manufacturers are demonstrating a more ambitious strategic direction. Herbapol Lublin aims to form a new group of companies that will integrate the firms that use the Herbapol brand. The company claims that five different firms using one brand need not be market rivals.  </p>
<p>The premiumisation trend will be accompanied by new tastes; for example variants such as ristretto, lungo, and cappuccino will be in demand. This will help to reduce the seasonality of coffee sales in Poland.  The strategic pooling of resources and marketing strategy being attempted by a player like Herbapol might be what is needed to create a domestic entity in tune with local trends and nimble enough to create products to meet this demand before international rivals respond.</p>

Consumers in Finland Look To Fair Trade Coffee,"Finland is one of the world's leading coffee-drinking nations with an annual per capita consumption of 10kg in 2010. Coffee has been popular in Finland for decades and its popularity is enhanced by the country's long and dark winters, when warm caffeine helps people to stay awake.","<p>Finland is one of the world's leading coffee-drinking nations with an annual per capita consumption of 10kg in 2010. Coffee has been popular in Finland for decades and its popularity is enhanced by the country's long and dark winters, when warm caffeine helps people to stay awake.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Demand for fair trade or ethical products grew in Finland in 2010 following growing consumer awareness about unfair working conditions around the world. Reports about the treatment of farmers regarding their unacceptably low wages, inhumane living conditions, lack of safety and exposure to pesticides frequently appeared in Finnish media. The moral aspect of multinational and global business conduct is an issue that many Finns consider important.</p>
<h2>Major market entry helps mainstream appeal</h2>
<p>Fair trade or ethical hot drinks first appeared in Finland in 1999, when they started to emerge in tea and coffee. Distribution was initially limited to retail channels, and products were positioned outside mainstream hot drinks.</p>
<p>Fair trade hot drinks were therefore a relatively minor phenomenon in Finland until the second largest coffee player, Meira Oy, launched its fair trade brand, Meiran Reilu Kahvi in 2006. This launch was quickly followed by leading player Gustav Paulig Oy Ab's launch of UTZ-certified coffee brand Paulig Mundo, first in the foodservice channel at the end of 2006 and then in 2007 in the retail channel. </p>
<p>Development increased since these first launches and even private label operators offered fair trade hot drinks in Finland in 2010. Major retail operator Kesko Oyj's Pirkka brand included fair trade coffee versions since 2007 and fair trade tea since 2008. The ranges were extended and renewed since then, most recently in 2010, when Pirkka launched a range of new fair trade hot drinks including a chocolate-based flavoured powder drink and a number of fair trade teas (black loose tea, Earl Grey loose tea, loose green tea and rooibos tea bags). </p>
<h2>Recession slowed sales momentum</h2>
<p>The variety of fair trade coffees offered at both branded premium and private label price levels helped make fair trade coffee  the most important fair trade product in Finland in 2010, with 200 products available (according to the trade organisation Fairtrade Finland). Fairtrade Finland reported that 545,600kg of fair trade coffee was sold in Finland in 2009, remaining more or less at the same level as in 2008. The economic recession halted the dynamic growth seen before 2009, mainly as foodservice sales declined strongly. In 2008 fair trade coffee grew by 17% in volume. </p>
<h2>New retail strategies</h2>
<p>Despite this recent setback, fair trade coffees are likely to prove a long-term success rather than a short-term trend. For producers this is good news, as fresh coffee overall is expected to show slowing growth in off-trade volume sales between 2010 and 2015 in Finland. The growing popularity of ethical products amongst Finnish consumers will help to improve margins and compensate for the slowdown in demand at the retail level. Moreover, with effective marketing campaigns, changing consumer attitudes will also ensure that ethical products meet with increasing success in tea and other hot drinks. </p>
<p>The growing importance of ethical coffees means that retailers will need to allocate shelf space for products such as fair trade, UTZ-certified and organic coffees. Retailers may begin to use ethical coffee as loss leaders to attract consumers into their outlets, rather than the classic loss leader, cheap coffee. </p>
<h2>Foodservice positioning offers opportunity</h2>
<p>Ethical coffees have also become popular in the foodservice channel, as companies are keen to present themselves as morally responsible business owners. Recently fast food giant McDonald's, for example, offered ethical coffee in its outlets. Overall though, foodservice fair trade coffee sales remain an untapped area ripe for further development in Finland. </p>
<p>In neighbouring Sweden, for example, the fair trade coffee trend is especially strong in the foodservice channel. According to Svensk Kaffeinformation, 30% of volume sales in the foodservice channel are accounted for by fair trade and organic coffee.  Two leading chained coffee shops – Espresso House and Barista Fair Trade – have decided to serve only fair trade and organic coffee. Both see the use of fair trade and organic coffee as a competitive advantage.   Major chains in Finland could use fair trade coffee to distinguish themselves from competitors in a similar way.</p>
<h2>Further potential</h2>
<p>In Sweden in 2010, fair trade coffee accounted for 14% of coffee volume sales compared with 6% in 2005, according to trade association Svensk Kaffeinformation. One reason is that the price difference between standard coffee and fair trade coffee has been reduced to make the products more accessible to the majority of consumers.</p>
<p>In Finland, only 1%-2% of all coffee volume sales were fair trade in 2010. Consumer awareness is predicted to increase and fair trade products will become more mainstream rather than being a niche. As such, the development of ethical coffee will have a significant influence on the future development of hot drinks, particularly as the economy recovers during the next five years. The launch of more retailer-driven private label fair trade coffees would likely have the same effect that it has had in Sweden – increasing the visibility of the segment while bringing down prices to a more appealing level for consumers without sacrificing entirely on margins.  As Finnish consumers become increasingly aware of how their decisions affect the environment and the fortunes of developing economies, many are willing to pay a little extra for products that are produced in accordance with ethical standards.</p>

JM Smucker Seeks Hispanic Coffee Consumers With Café Bustelo Purchase,"The JM Smucker Co announced the US$360 million acquisition of the Café Bustelo, Café Pilon, and other related coffee brands from Florida-based Rowland Coffee Roasters in May 2011, in a move to expand their US coffee position. ","<p>The JM Smucker Co announced the US$360 million acquisition of the Café Bustelo, Café Pilon, and other related coffee brands from Florida-based Rowland Coffee Roasters in May 2011, in a move to expand their US coffee position. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The two main coffees are espresso versions with distribution concentrated mainly in the Florida and Northeastern regions of the US, but Café Bustelo also has a national distribution on a limited basis, often appearing in Hispanic supermarkets in major cities.</p>
<h2>JM Smucker corporate strategy</h2>
<p>With the exception of premium products such as Folgers Gourmet Selections, JM Smucker's coffee brands are priced somewhat lower than those of premium competitors such as Starbucks. The company is able to leverage its existing distribution agreements with major supermarket chains and Wal-Mart to introduce new products quickly to a wide consumer base – an advantage not enjoyed by many of the company's more regional or speciality-focused competitors.</p>
<p>The company has a wide range of brands covering both the low- and high-price segments. JM Smucker's mass market brand, Folgers, has been doing extremely well during the economic downturn, solidifying the top spot in fresh coffee (ground and beans) with a 12% off-trade value share. The company also has higher-end products, Millstone and Dunkin' Donuts, the latter of which is often seen as a direct competitor with Starbucks coffee. Dunkin' Donuts was able to utilise JM Smucker's strong relationship with retailers in its nationwide launch and grew over the review period to hold fifth spot among fresh coffee brands with a 4% value share in 2010. This is a strategy the company will likely look to replicate with Café Bustelo. </p>
<p>JM Smucker also will get a production facility in Miami in the deal, but the company has already announced their intent to shift production to an existing facility in New Orleans.  Nevertheless, JM Smucker's coffee operations gain scale with this deal and the company can realize savings from existing infrastructure.  JM Smucker has a history of doing this in other product categories with recent acquisitions including Knott's Berry Farm jams and spreads, Crisco shortening, and Jif peanut butter, among others.</p>
<h2>Niche brands with Cuban origins</h2>
<p>Both Café Bustelo and Café Pilon are darker, espresso-style roasts with roots in Cuban production. Jose “Pepe” Souto started Rowland Coffee Roasters in Florida in 1960 after fleeing Cuba once Fidel Castro came to power.  Souto's family had made coffee in Cuba since 1865.  Both coffees gained a following with the Cuban expat population in Miami and New York, with a marketing emphasis on the strong flavour and relatively cheap price of the brands when compared to market leaders like Maxwell House and Folgers. </p>
<p>Over time, the original blend has never changed, giving Bustelo a consistent appeal.  National distribution has slowly increased over the last 30 years, and technological advances have also helped broaden the brand's appeal.  Rowland was one of the first US coffee roasters to embrace vacuum-packed, “brick” packaging in 1982, at a time when most ground coffee still was being offered in cans.</p>
<h2>New consumer segments</h2>
<p>According to recent US Census reports, by the year 2050, nearly one quarter of the US population is expected to be Hispanic.  Café Bustelo is probably the most well known brand in the US targeting this consumer group specifically in 2011.  As such, it represents a bolt-on piece that fits alongside Folgers and Dunkin Donuts coffees at a similar or lower price point while at the same time reaching an important new consumer group.  Both Café Bustelo and Café Pilon have a built in brand equity that should continue to resonate with consumers.  This should give JM Smucker an advantage over any other competitor trying to reach this segment through a new brand launch.</p>
<p>Rowland Coffee Roasters also has Bustelo Cool, an RTD coffee line offered in 8.3 oz cans that replicate the distinctive bright yellow colour palette of the bagged coffees.  The brand had a limited launch in New York and Miami in 2008, mostly in supermarkets located in Hispanic areas of these cities, targeting young consumers.  Since then, Bustelo Cool in particular has gained a growing following among young adults, with a sponsored presence at influential cultural events such as the Coachella Valley Music Festival, Oscars after parties, and the Sundance Film Festival.  With a sustained marketing effort, JM Smucker might be able to extend this brand visibility to its bagged coffees, building a connection to a new generation of consumers who to this point have been more likely to adopt well known premium brands like Starbucks.</p>
<h2>Strategic fit</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the Café Bustelo acquisition fits with JM Smucker's overall strategy of building a complimentary portfolio of brands focused on breakfast foods and beverages.  In an increasingly crowded US coffee marketplace with new innovations like single source coffee and the emergence of coffee pod systems, relying on a single primary brand, even one as established as Folgers, will become less and less effective.  The opportunities for new, influential brand launches will be increasingly rare.  Thus, coffee sales growth is more likely to be obtained from reaching new distribution points and new consumer segments.  Café Bustelo should fill this role nicely, even if it does not have the same overall growth potential as the larger brands based on popular coffee specialist chains.</p>

Strategic Alliances in Coffee: How to Drive Premium Sales through Free Rental Distribution,"Investment in coffee pods is allowing coffee brewers to grow, even in mature markets. Euromonitor International examines the Italian market and the different strategic alliance deals a coffee player can undertake and asks if free rental of coffee machines is a viable growth strategy in Western Europe.","<p>Investment in coffee pods is allowing coffee brewers to grow, even in mature markets. Euromonitor International examines the Italian market and the different strategic alliance deals a coffee player can undertake and asks if free rental of coffee machines is a viable growth strategy in Western Europe.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>The fresh coffee market in Italy</h3>
<p>In Italy, coffee pods recorded close to a 35% increase in retail value sales in 2010, albeit from a low base. In addition, coffee pods' share of fresh ground coffee is set to more than double over the forecast period, moving from an 8% retail value share in 2010 to a 15% value share in 2015. To put it into context, while coffee pods are expected to grow at a 16% retail value CAGR during 2010-2015, over the same period sales of standard fresh ground coffee are expected to stagnate. </p>
<p>Despite the higher unit prices of pods, when compared to lose ground coffee, even conservative Italian consumers continue to be attracted to pod systems, even during harder economic times. This is partially thanks to a combination of positioning, high-quality coffee blends, innovation, and mess-free functioning. Instead of having to dose out loose coffee, consumers simply add a pre-packaged coffee pod into a machine, press a button, and wait for espresso to drip out directly into their cup.</p>
<p>Most hard pod coffee machines use a closed system, meaning that these machines only take one type of capsule, which are typically supplied directly by coffee distributors. This means that when consumers buy a closed system machine their choice of coffee type and drink is limited to the options that each hot drinks company supplies. Nescafé Dolce Gusto, Nespresso and A Modo Mio are currently the main brands available in hard pod formats in Italy.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, in Italy, the leading company within hard coffee pods is Lavazza. The Italian manufacturer ranks first in value terms within coffee pods in Italy. Lavazza's success in coffee pods is partly due to the huge success of its A Modo Mio, Lavazza Blue and Lavazza Espresso Point brands, and is strong on the back of the consolidation of the company's lead within fresh coffee and the distribution of free rental coffee machines.</p>
<h3>The case study: Lavazza's business plan for the distribution of coffee machines</h3>
<p>Lavazza's partnership with different coffee machines manufacturers has enabled the company to promptly develop closed systems for each of its different pod variants and helped maintain its position ahead of the fast-growing Nespresso brand. Additionally, the Italian company's strong brand recognition among Italian consumers has certainly been a plus.</p>
<p>Lavazza's strong brand equity within hard pods is the result of a strategy that successfully mixes a varied offering of closed system coffee machines – which has enabled the company to widen its pods portfolio – with diversified domestic distribution. In Italy, besides the Saeco Lavazza A Modo Mio, which is widely available through normal retail channels and through Saeco's distribution network, Lavazza also offers its own range of closed hard pod coffee machines. The mid-range Lavazza Espresso Point and the top-of-the-range Lavazza Blue coffee machines are both manufactured by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and designed by Italian designers, such as the famous company Pininfarina. Lavazza Espresso Point and Lavazza Blue machines are sold directly by Lavazza or available through selected distributors with a free rental contract.</p>
<p>In general, with a free rental agreement, coffee distributors guarantee the supply of the latest models of closed coffee machines and the replacement of faulty models. In return, consumer ties themselves into a renewable fixed-term contract (often 12 or 24 months), during which they guarantee a minimum monthly order of coffee pods. Lavazza, however, thanks to the success of its pods, does not require any minimum order, meaning that, for consumers, the perceived advantage of free rentals is even greater. According to one of the main distributors in the north of Italy, overall, the free rental of hard pod coffee machines is a growing trend: “We estimate that within our geographic scope, 10% of consumers ordering hard coffee pods don't actually own a coffee machine but rent it, for free.”</p>
<p>Free rental is hardly a new trend. Distributors have been providing closed system coffee machines to small business for years. What is new, this time, is that this kind distribution model is now becoming popular among consumers as well, especially as disposable incomes have come under increasing pressure in Europe over the past two years. With a free rental agreement in place, coffee pods are then sold for 10% less than their normal RSP.</p>
<p>What matters to coffee brewers such as Lavazza is driving sales of high-value coffee pods, a goal that the diversified and capillary distribution channels have successfully helped achieving. This sort of partnership with drinks distributors has enabled Lavazza to build further brand equity by gaining those consumers that appreciate premium coffee but that are not willing to spend money on an expensive coffee machine. Through partnerships with Lavazza, distributors are also able to guarantee full technical assistance and often claim to be able to replace the coffee machine on the same day in case of fault.</p>
<h3>The advantages of the free rental business model</h3>
<p>For both coffee players and hot drinks distributors, free rentals generate guaranteed volume sales. With the majority of sales coming through the business-to-consumer rather than the business-to-business channel for coffee players, this certainly has its advantages in securing medium-term sales. For manufacturers that tie in with a premium coffee player with local brand equity, this model can also help develop medium-term sales and replacements.</p>
<p>Would this kind of distribution agreement be beneficial for appliance manufacturers? It does not appear to be a strategy that companies such as Nespresso are, at the moment, willing to pursue. Nevertheless, although Nespresso originally built its image around the aspirational idea of possessing super-premium coffee machines, it is now improving its price mix by widening its offering of mid-low-priced coffee machines. In 2010, Nespresso launched the Nespresso Pixie, a cheaper model designed to appeal to younger and less affluent consumers. Additionally, the company is strengthening the production of its mid-to-low-tier Nescafé Dolce Gusto machines by extending the licence from Groupe SEB to De'Longhi.</p>
<p>In hard hit markets such as Portugal, Greece and Spain, consumers are expected to forgo the purchase of non-essential products, and this negative trend may also extend to premium pod coffee machines, potentially slowing down the volume forecast. For companies such as Nespresso, which have invested exclusively in closed brewing systems, sales of coffee pods depend on sales of coffee machines. In this context, the free rental distribution model could be a winning solution. On the one hand, it could successfully counter balance a slowdown in coffee machine sales, while, at the same time, maintaining volume sales of coffee pods.</p>
<h3>What's the potential in other Western European markets?</h3>
<p>Further aspects make free rental an interesting model in other European markets. The Western European market for fresh coffee in 2010 was worth US$13 billion in retail value terms, nearly double the size of the US market, accounting for over a third of global retail value sales in the same year. Appliance players are all, in one way or another, trying to tap into the fast-growing and highly-valuable hard pods coffee machines category, rushing to patent their closed coffee brewing systems, whilst twinning with major fresh coffee brands. In this context, the free rental model enables companies to build brand trust through distributors that guarantee an extensive presence. Secondly, and more importantly, it enables both coffee and appliances companies to generate additional volume sales by reaching consumers that otherwise would not buy their products because of their high price tags.</p>
<p>To be successful, distribution deals such as free rental require appliances manufacturer to partner with a leading coffee brewer and with a distributor that can guarantee both, an extensive supply of coffee pods as well as an excellent after sales assistance covering the coffee machines. Such a partnership can prove capable of generating sales by extending the consumer base and stimulate replacement through the agreement with distributors for the supply of the latest coffee machines models.</p>

The Challenges of Building a Local Coffee Culture in Kenya,"In a story that is common to many of the world's coffee growing regions, local Kenyan coffee manufacturers can often struggle to be noticed by Kenyan consumers.  The Kenyan hot drinks market has always been dominated by tea; thus it is a major challenge for coffee companies to convince consumers, particularly the older generation, to switch from drinking tea to coffee. Besides the deeply entrenched tradition of opting for tea rather than coffee, there is a perception among consumers that coffee ","<p>In a story that is common to many of the world's coffee growing regions, local Kenyan coffee manufacturers can often struggle to be noticed by Kenyan consumers.  The Kenyan hot drinks market has always been dominated by tea; thus it is a major challenge for coffee companies to convince consumers, particularly the older generation, to switch from drinking tea to coffee. Besides the deeply entrenched tradition of opting for tea rather than coffee, there is a perception among consumers that coffee is expensive. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In retail value terms, Kenyan tea sales were nearly 20% higher than coffee in 2010.  Coffee sales are dominated by instant coffees, which comprised more than 99% of the category in value sales terms.  As a result, in Kenya, imported brands reign, and Nestlé Foods Kenya led in 2010 with its Nescafé instant coffee brand holding a 52% volume share, followed by Cacique de Café Solúvel, Cia, then Sasini Tea & Coffee Ltd, with its locally manufactured coffee brands. Nescafé instant coffee is very popular with middle- and low-income consumers thanks to its affordability and convenience.</p>
<h2>New urban coffee culture leads to increased competition </h2>
<p>Coffee is one of Kenya's leading exports, with most beans destined for European countries and the US. This means that most of the coffee produced locally is processed and exported, whilst only a fraction is sold in the local market. In 2010 there was an increased trend towards coffee shops, as consumers became more aware of coffee specialities such as latté, cappuccino and macchiato. There is a new urban coffee culture, which was a boon to coffee producers, leading to increased competition between coffee shops.</p>
<p>With the budding coffee drinking culture in Kenya, foodservice outlets focused on increasing their number of outlets in urban centres. In just a few years, big names such as Dormans and Java had to contend with new entrants such as Savannah, Coffee World, Kahawa, Kapital Coffee, The Coffee House and The Mug, as well as many others which have become concentrated in city centres. Dormans, the overall leader in fresh coffee retail sales, has 11 branches in the busiest areas of Nairobi and Mombasa, whilst Java has 10.</p>
<h2>Kenyan coffee farmers engage in direct coffee marketing</h2>
<p>Small-scale coffee farmers will have the opportunity to directly sell their produce to the international market as a result of a new marketing initiative by Kenya Cooperative Coffee Exporters (KCCE). The Cooperative is an initiative by smallholder coffee farmers. It was formed to maximise returns on coffee sales by engaging directly in coffee marketing, rather than going through the auction system. The entry of KCCE is expected to promote higher prices for farmers. This will boost their incomes and lead to higher production, better quality coffee and improved foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<h2>Fair trade opportunity in the domestic market</h2>
<p>With the rising demand for coffee shops in major cities, as it is a new, trendy culture amongst consumers, more players are set to invest in the coffee category.  With the existence of new marketing bodies in Kenya such as KCCE, better prices for farmers will mean increased production, and hence growth in the category.   </p>
<p>With such an emphasis on the benefits to coffee growers and the impact this can have on the economies of local communities, there is perhaps an opportunity to promote the adoption of more expensive fresh coffees in the domestic retail market on the basis of Fair Trade certification.  Fresh coffee market leader C Dorman, for example, buys fair trade coffee from farmers and sells it at a premium. This creates the opportunity for coffee brands, retailers and end-consumers to trace the place of origin of the coffee, and provides them with the assurance that the coffee they have purchased has been sourced from responsible producers.  </p>
<p>Though fresh coffee is still a nascent segment in Kenya, sales are led by three major domestic producers, in stark contrast to instant coffees.  By highlighting the enhanced quality of fresh coffee and the benefits to local communities that come from Fair Trade practices, local producers could provide a contrast to the Nescafés found in most homes in Kenya, and begin to build upon the momentum of a growing coffee shop culture.</p>

How Is Coffee Finding Success in Latin America?,"Latin America was the fastest growing region in the world for coffee retail value sales in 2010, with a 13% gain, making this the third out of the last four years that the region showed a double digit increase, in constant 2010 value terms.  Euromonitor International examines some of the factors driving growth in coffee sales in this part of the world.","<p>Latin America was the fastest growing region in the world for coffee retail value sales in 2010, with a 13% gain, making this the third out of the last four years that the region showed a double digit increase, in constant 2010 value terms.

<h2>Attracting young consumers in Argentina</h2>
<p>In Argentina the number of specialist coffee shops has steadily increased since 2004, mainly through chains such as Aroma, Café Martínez, The Coffee Store, Bonafide, Havanna, McCafé and Starbucks. The total number of specialist outlets increased from 451 to 630 over 2004-2009, and although they make up a small portion of total on-trade operators, these chains have managed to attract young consumers by offering a more relaxed store ambiance.</p>
<p>According to data from the Cámara Argentina del Café, Argentines typically begin consuming coffee around the age of 25-27 and are now doing so at an earlier age thanks to modern chains such as Starbucks and McCafé. Their ability to attract younger consumers lies mainly in the novelty factor created through a different type of outlet compared with traditional cafés, and through the different products offered, such as cappuccinos, lattes, chai tea and iced coffee, which have not previously been popular in Argentina. Young consumers' exposure to these products is resulting in demand for home consumption, helping categories such as speciality instant coffee experience high growth in 2010.</p>
<p>Speciality chains are expected to continue growing over the next five years. As an example of the category's dynamism, Starbucks has announced that the company will invest US$12 million to reach 30 outlets by the end of 2011. The company will begin to move into the country's interior, where chains are less developed. Other chains are expected to follow a similar expansion plan through own stores and franchising in order to benefit from the growing coffee culture.</p>
<h2>Experimentation with premium coffee in Brazil</h2>
<p>After Starbucks entered the Brazilian market, existing coffee shops renovated their spaces and adjusted their menus to offer a more comfortable atmosphere, emulating Starbucks' strategy. Specialist coffee shops have been expanding the number of outlets, either independently or through franchise, increasing 41% between 2005 and 2010 according to Euromonitor International's Consumer Foodservice research.</p>
<p>In affluent neighbourhoods of the largest cities, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, it is very easy to find a specialist coffee shop offering several options of gourmet coffee. Like the expansion of wine over the last five years in Brazil, gourmet coffee is now a topic of conversation and more aficionados are starting to appear, trying the different types of coffee outside of home and buying premium beans and blends for home consumption.</p>
<p>According to BSCA (Brazilian Speciality Coffee Association), between 2007 and 2009 more than 150 brands of speciality coffee were launched in the Brazilian market. Since producer margins of speciality coffee are around 50%, whilst margins of regular robusta coffee are around 15-20%, several producers are starting to invest in the harvest of speciality Arabica beans. Currently 90% of the Brazilian production of Arabica is exported, but with the growing interest of consumers in gourmet coffee, an increasing amount of production might stay in the country.  </p>
<p>Even though gourmet coffee is more expensive than regular coffee, it is considered to be an affordable luxury for home consumption, and consumers who have tried higher-quality coffee at coffee shops are starting to bring it home as well.  This movement might also impel leading coffee players to launch their own gourmet brands with Arabica beans; although some brands like Pilão have the so-called special coffee blends, they are still made with robusta beans.</p>
<h2>Government measures in Peru</h2>
<p>Although Peruvian coffee is famous worldwide for its quality, domestic consumption is still low. Indeed, Peru has the third lowest per capita coffee consumption rate in Latin America due to the fact that the country does not have a coffee drinking culture like in other markets such as Costa Rica and Brazil. In an effort to raise consumption, the government continues to invest in promotional activities such as coffee fairs and the celebration of National Day of Coffee each fourth Friday of August. In addition, companies participating in this area are increasing investment in educating consumers on the health benefits of coffee consumption and providing frequent tasting sessions through supermarket/hypermarkets.</p>
<h2>Fresh coffee surpasses instant coffee in Mexico</h2>
<p>Since the entry of Starbucks in Mexico, a new coffee culture has been created in the country. Due to wider availability of freshly brewed coffee and its better quality, consumers are growing more aware of the different types of coffee and their respective characteristics. Although most Mexicans do not own a coffee machine, instant coffee showed a less dynamic increase than fresh coffee in 2010.   In 2002, fresh coffee represented 40% of total volumes, whereas in 2010, this type had increased its share to 60%. </p>
<p>Part of the reason for fresh coffee's surge in popularity lies with measures manufacturers have taken to conform to local preferences.  For example, it is very common to find coffee with sugar, not only in instant coffee, but also in fresh coffee (with brands such as Café Legal, Blasón or Garat regularly having 30% sugar content).  Market leader Sabormex also has several fresh ground coffees offered at lower than standard prices, specifically targeting low-income consumers in an effort to entice them away from instant coffee, as well as other brands like Oro and Tazza offered at more standard and premium prices.</p>
<p>The per capita consumption of coffee in Latin America is around 2kg, while in Mexico the average is only 0.6kg, which signals that there is room to drive demand for these products upwards.  With Sabormex controlling more than 40% of retail fresh coffee sales, growth is more likely to come from brands linked to chained coffee specialists.  As these formats push into areas in Mexico beyond the major cities, new competitors may arrive, fostering competition and expanding the range of options available to the consumer.</p>

Coffee Prices Lingering Near Record Highs,"Arabica coffee prices hit a 34 year high in early May 2011, a culmination of several factors including increased global demand, higher oil prices, and lower than average coffee yields due to adverse weather patterns in some parts of the world.  Colombia, the world's larger producer of arabica coffee, is still recovering from a 2009 crop year that saw the smallest harvest in more than three decades.  Brazil, the world's largest overall coffee producer, is expected to see the largest off-year crop","<p>Arabica coffee prices hit a 34 year high in early May 2011, a culmination of several factors including increased global demand, higher oil prices, and lower than average coffee yields due to adverse weather patterns in some parts of the world.  Colombia, the world's larger producer of arabica coffee, is still recovering from a 2009 crop year that saw the smallest harvest in more than three decades.  Brazil, the world's largest overall coffee producer, is expected to see the largest off-year crop on record in 2011, though the full effect on supply will likely not be felt until the 2012/13 harvest.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>According to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), the 2010/11 crop year began with coffee stocks at the lowest levels seen since ICO began taking records in 1965.  Total coffee prices began to fall somewhat in May and were down 5% in June, but are still up from the same period in 2010 and are likely to remain well above US$1 per pound until depleted stocks are rebuilt.</p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h2>Price spike could last for years</h2>
<p>In addition to the delay in Brazil's biennial harvest cycle, other factors could lead to a more prolonged period of higher coffee prices, even as growers take steps to capitalise on coffee's higher profitability.   Investments made now typically take two to three years for the trees to mature enough to achieve a resulting increase in output, meaning supply will likely lag the continued increase in demand.  </p>
<p>Farmers have tended towards exclusive supply agreements with global manufacturers in recent years and with this has come increased education about proper maintenance and fertilizer use.  This kind of focus on maximizing production in Colombia, for example, could lead to an extra 1.5-2 bags per hectare, or a 10% supply increase nationwide, according to Colombia's coffee federation.</p>
<p>But in the meantime existing supply contracts from before the current phase of price increases are ending, and manufacturers have engaged in several rounds of retail price hikes in 2010 and through early 2011.  JM Smucker announced an 11% retail price increase in May 2011 on its Folgers and Dunkin Donuts coffees, following a 10% increase in February, a 9% increase in August 2010, and a 4% increase in May 2010.  Typically other major producers follow suit soon after one price increase is announced, including in this case Starbucks, which refrained from a major increase on coffee sold in its stores in the US in 2010 but instituted a 17% rise in prices on 12 July.</p>
<h2>Demand remains among consumers</h2>
<p>Despite the ever increasing prices of coffee, consumer purchasing of coffee for at home use has not seen any significant slowdown.  According to ICO figures, global coffee consumption reached 134 million 60 kg bags in 2010, while coffee output for 2010/11 was expected to reach only 133 million bags.  In a similar fashion, coffee demand is expected to outpace supply in the near term, especially as consumers in developed markets return as well to greater on trade coffee purchasing following the downturn seen during the recent global economic recession.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International is predicting a slightly slowing range of 2.0-2.5% global coffee volume sales growth from 2010-2015, but value sales growth is expected to consistently outpace volume growth. Global value sales growth is also predicted to accelerate until 2013, after which supply will likely begin to catch up to demand.</p>
<p></p>

<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\bb2dc801-5bb5-401d-8a3c-407ad4aca45d.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h2>Producers voice concerns</h2>
<p>This impending increase in supply has led producers like Illycaffe to caution that cycles of over and undersupply could be in store over the longer term, adding to coffee price volatility.  A similar cycle was observed in 1998, with subsequent supply flooding the market in 2001 and leading to nearly a decade of lowered prices and reduced profitability until oil prices drove major commodities higher in 2008. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has laid the blame for higher prices on hedge funds and other financial speculators, claiming that there is no global supply crisis at all and that higher prices are not translating into more revenue for coffee farmers.  He is among many who would like to see reforms for greater transparency in the commodities futures market in response to the current situation.</p>
<p>While the root cause is likely some combination of all of the factors mentioned above, the end result is that there is a growing risk of consumers responding by purchasing less coffee in the next two years than they otherwise would have.  This is especially true of on trade coffee sales through chained coffee shops, fast food outlets, and other restaurants.  Consumers already reduced trips to such outlets during the recession years of 2008-2009, and may be wary of coming back while coffee prices inch ever higher.  Coffee manufacturers will need to ensure they are differentiating through product innovation and quality, loyalty programs, and efforts to enhance convenience if they hope to justify these recent added costs of purchase.</p>

Upheaval in Israel Coffee Market Illustrates Risks of Premium Licensing Partnerships,"On 1 January 2010 Strauss Group, Israel's leading coffee manufacturer, lost its only international premium brand Jacobs to Diplomat Distributors (1968) Ltd, one of the strongest distributors within the Israeli market.  Diplomat received the exclusive rights to distribute and market all Kraft products within Israel. This has created a problematic situation for Strauss as its front against second ranked Osem Food Industries Ltd. was shaken.  ","<p>On 1 January 2010 Strauss Group, Israel's leading coffee manufacturer, lost its only international premium brand Jacobs to Diplomat Distributors (1968) Ltd, one of the strongest distributors within the Israeli market.  Diplomat received the exclusive rights to distribute and market all Kraft products within Israel. This has created a problematic situation for Strauss as its front against second ranked Osem Food Industries Ltd. was shaken.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Coffee in Israel is a highly competitive and concentrated category with a handful of players dominating sales and shelf presence. Strauss Group is the leading player within coffee and accounts for more than half total value sales. Strauss has leading local brands within all categories excluding fresh coffee beans and tends to be a trend setter within coffee. Strauss's main competitor Osem, however, holds the strongest premium international brand, Taster's Choice.  The loss of Kraft's Jacobs leaves Strauss without an international premium brand and with only its local Elite Sources of Coffee brand as a premium priced offering.</p>
<h2>Strauss still comfortable at the top</h2>
<p>Strauss Group continued to dominate retail coffee sales in Israel in 2010 with a 55% value share, though this was down nearly six percentage points after the loss of the Kraft brands. Strauss holds some of the largest and most successful brands within retail coffee:  Elite Turkish accounted for 78% of fresh ground coffee volume sales in 2010, while Elite accounted for a leading 51% share of instant coffee volume sales in 2010.   Elite is a traditional mass-market favourite and is consumed by the majority of the population. </p>
<h2>A new competitor emerges</h2>
<p>Even though Strauss still has a formidable overall lead, its position is more vulnerable today than it was in 2009.  First, Strauss is at a disadvantage to second leading player Osem as Osem holds the leading premium international brand, Nescafé Taster's Choice, while Strauss is now left without a comparable brand in its portfolio. During 2010 consumer preferences were changing as they were seeking higher quality and switching towards more premium brands with an emphasis on international premium brands. Accordingly, Nescafé Taster's Choice witnessed the largest share growth. </p>
<p>Strauss and Osem still controlled more than 70% of coffee value sales in Israel in 2010, but the new deal between Kraft and Diplomat Distributors helped Diplomat to make a strong entrance in coffee in Israel, and saw it account for almost 5% of total coffee retail value sales in 2010.  Diplomat is one of the largest distributors in Israel and has a strong advantage over many players. Diplomat is the distributor of Procter & Gamble Israel MOD Ltd and has one of the strongest networks along with the tools to push products, market them and deal with major international companies. </p>
<p>During 2010, coffee in Israel became even more competitive with the growing presence of private label products alongside unit price decreases of leading brands.  Such competition more strongly impacts standard priced coffees, which comprise the bulk of the Strauss Group portfolio, while premium coffees are more able to differentiate and remain somewhat shielded from lower priced options.  In less than a year, Diplomat has emerged as a strong third place competitor in coffee, and is beginning to gain share and pose a real threat on the strength of sales growth from Jacobs.  Pressure is also coming smaller premium independents like Lavazza. </p>
<h2>Partnerships can leave companies exposed to strategic portfolio gaps</h2>
<p>Strauss Group is expected to respond to this move during the next few years, however, it is uncertain as to which solution it will turn. One direction that Strauss can take is to import and exclusively distribute a new premium international coffee brand within Israel.  Another might be to adapt a new premium brand for Israeli retail sales, such as the Totti Caffe capsule system it currently offers in Russia, Ukraine, and other countries in the region.  In the meantime, Diplomat is expected to put a stronger focus on Jacobs and is put its strong advantages to use by pushing the brand into new channels. </p>
<p>Kraft's shifting allegiances in Israeli coffee distribution echo a similar situation that played out in 2011 in its home market of the US.  This time, Starbucks was the premium coffee brand that severed ties and Kraft was the distributor now left without a major premium coffee offering in the grocery channel.  Kraft has since announced plans to emphasize its premium Gevalia coffee, but replacing the more than US$400 million in revenue represented by Starbucks will be an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>Both examples show the risks inherent in a domestic coffee leader relying on a distribution partnership to provide a key premium growth brand.  While such arrangements can be profitable for both parties initially, a re-organisation over time from the premium coffee manufacturer often conflicts with current local market distribution contracts.  Strategic changes can thus bring about new disagreements over control and direction of the brand. This usually means that local players either have to adapt to new agreements or often give up on brands.   For a coffee manufacturer, a clear market lead can become suddenly vulnerable if they have not already taken additional steps to broaden their premium coffee offerings.  </p>

This report discusses the differences in regional coffee trends and seeks to help identify where opportunities for premiumisation in coffee lie over the next five years.","<p>Coffee sales showed a slowing but still steady growth trend during the recent recession years before bouncing back in 2010.  But with commodity pricing pressures and established preferences for tea in many regions, a move towards higher margin coffees will become an increasingly central part of future growth strategies.  This report discusses the differences in regional coffee trends and seeks to help identify where opportunities for premiumisation in coffee lie over the next five years.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Key trends discussed include: </p>
<h2>Coffee sales grow even through recession</h2>
<p>Sales saw a slowdown especially in 2009 but had a strong recovery by 2010.  Instant coffee in particular saw improved performance as consumers traded down from more expensive coffees.</p>
<h2>Price pressures remain for manufacturers</h2>
<p>Global commodity prices for coffee are seeing 30 year highs in 2011 and have more than doubled over the last two years.  An effort to portray the premium quality possible in coffee is needed to help ease the burden of retail price increases.</p>
<h2>Divergent regional tastes</h2>
<p>Centuries of tradition and varying degrees of market penetration have given rise to vastly different consumer preferences for tea and coffee between regions.  Overcoming established habits of tea drinking remains a challenge in many areas.</p>
<h2>Coffee specialist chains on the rise in tea drinking countries</h2>
<p>Chains like Starbucks still have the bulk of their business in Western nations, but tea drinking nations are among the top growth markets for coffee specialists, and represent the largest opportunity moving forward.</p>
<h2>Premium potential exists for coffee</h2>
<p>Coffee has seen some global success from premium brands while tea has been more limited, with Lipton as the only true global leader. Tea is viewed as a commodity in many major markets whereas coffee can be introduced as an affordable luxury.  </p>
<h2>New price tiers for instant coffee </h2>
<p>Long viewed as a generally cheap option, instant coffee is evolving with larger and single serve sizes, premium launches like Starbucks VIA, and the development of 3-in-1 speciality options with local flavours, creating more differences in price.</p>
<h2>Pods will generate the largest share of fresh coffee growth</h2>
<p>Though they are still popularized mainly in Western Europe and North American markets, single brew coffee pods systems have crossed into mainstream acceptance and are expected to continue to offer the best premium opportunity.</p>
<h2>Competition from other producers is intensifying</h2>
<p>Major tea and soft drinks manufacturers have already begun to move into coffee partnerships.  The space is expected to become more crowded as core categories of tea, carbonates, and bottled water offer limited chances for premiumisation.</p>

The Success of Coffee Pods Indicates Further Potential for Other Pod Formats,"Despite geographical restrictions, retail value sales of coffee pods exceeded US$4 billion in 2010, nearly four times the level they were in 2005. Keurig pod machines by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters drove the recent growth in North America, overshadowing Nespresso and Dolce Gusto machines by Nestlé, which are more established in Western Europe and Latin America (see the article: “Strategic Alliances in Coffee: The Nespresso Effect”).","<p>Despite geographical restrictions, retail value sales of coffee pods exceeded US$4 billion in 2010, nearly four times the level they were in 2005. Keurig pod machines by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters drove the recent growth in North America, overshadowing Nespresso and Dolce Gusto machines by Nestlé, which are more established in Western Europe and Latin America (see the article: “Strategic Alliances in Coffee: The Nespresso Effect”).</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Sales of coffee pods are still mainly concentrated in Western Europe, though markets are developing in the US and Brazil, as well as other parts of the world. Some US$2 billion additional coffee pod value sales are expected over 2010-2015.</p>
<h3>What the prospect for appliances manufacturers?</h3>
<p>Appliances manufacturers, and in particular those exposed to troubled Western markets, are all, in one way or another, trying to tap into the fast-growing and highly valuable hard pods coffee machines category. On the one hand, small appliances manufacturers are rushing to patent their closed coffee brewing systems, twinning with major fresh coffee brands. On the other, major appliances manufacturers are trying to drive sales of their designer lines by incorporating coffee pods machines into their built-in portfolios. </p>
<p>In the context of a fragile recovery in Western Europe and North America the launch of coffee machines possessing attractive designs and novel technological features so far successfully tempted consumers into buying them. Globally, the market has still not reached saturation and there are still large business opportunities available to the leading players.</p>
<p>The partnership between appliances manufacturers and coffee companies for sales of coffee pod machines is proving a winning one for companies such as Philips, De'Longhi and SEB Groupe, which are still exposed to sluggish Western markets.</p>
<p>Over 30% of De'Longhi's reported revenues were generated by coffee machines in 2010. By shifting to food preparation appliances and coffee machines, and thanks to its partnership with Nespresso, De'Longhi was able to increase its reported net profits from €32 million in 2009 to €75 million in 2010.</p>
<p>Similarly, SEB Groupe has been able to turn to the premium segment to re-establish dynamism in certain categories and mature markets, with products such as its Krups Nespresso coffee pod machines, becoming key drivers for growth, while generating higher margins.</p>
<p>The success of the Saeco Lavazza a Modo Mio coffee pod machines has helped consolidate Philips' second-placed ranking within the global coffee machines market. Additionally, adding a premium brand to the company's portfolio is leaving Philips with an opportunity to develop a share in North America, should they decide to tailor their system to the American preference for bigger size coffees, as demonstrated by the huge success of the Keurig pod machines by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.</p>
<h3>Further potential for growth of multi drinks machines</h3>
<p>In markets where tea and chocolate pods have already been launched, rapid sales growth has followed. The leading market for tea pods, the US, saw sales triple during 2008-2010, while even the UK, where tea pods were launched much earlier, saw a doubling of sales during 2005-2010.</p>
<p>France, on the other hand, is the only market to record substantial chocolate pod sales, and the country saw a similar story of rapid consumer acceptance only a few years after major product launches were made. Chocolate pods are often seen as a natural progression from coffee, and are already appearing in market such as UK and Germany and are likely to build in more markets if coffee pod volumes continue growing.</p>
<p>The Bosh Tassimo coffee pod machines for example already allow consumers to prepare hot chocolate, as Tassimo includes Côte d'Or, Suchard and Milka hot chocolate in their pod range. Similarly, Caffitaly, which distributes the coffee pods for the Dualit coffee machines, also offers chocolate pods in its hot drinks range.</p>
<p>Such launches help add to the versatility of pod systems. There are also cold (iced) coffee extensions from players such as Green Mountain and Starbucks, indicating that further innovation and flavour development is likely in markets where pods gain a critical mass of distribution and consumer acceptance.</p>
<p>Competition is however becoming tougher and it is crucial for appliances players to partner with the right coffee manufacturers. In order to increase the market and prevent customers from switching to competitors, coffee brewers are trying to create an obligation among their respective consumer bases to find pods compatible with their machines. In order to develop new pod varieties capable of meeting consumer expectations, coffee brewers are diversifying their offerings by launching new flavours and by widening their hot drinks offerings. </p>
<p>Against the upsurge of a growing number of players in pods and capsules and at the risk of losing ground or opportunities in the mass market, manufacturers are focusing on launching machines with exclusive (closed) pod systems to encourage more loyal customers, keep intact margins and limit the entrance of private label. In this context, multi-task machines are also likely to become a priority for manufacturers and coffee players as evidenced by the success of the Nescafé Dolce Gusto coffee machine, due to its ability to make not only coffee but also tea and chocolate.</p>

The number of baristas in the country compared to international standards is low and the consumer level of true appreciation of higher quality coffee is not as developed as in other regions. As such, the culture of drinking real espresso is limited. Malaysians are mostly exposed to local drinks, such as kopi-o, kopi siu tai, Hong Kong milk tea, Ximut milk tea, Milo kao kao. Many consider Ipoh White Coffee as a Western term for “cappuccino” or “Espresso” as Kopi-O. However, most locals only know espresso as being bitter. The consumers who truly understand and appreciate gourmet coffee are considered coffee enthusiasts who are trying to bring a whole new standard of gourmet coffee experience to Malaysia.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Challenges in getting instant coffee drinkers to switch</h2>
<p>Retail sales of fresh coffee in 2010 did not even reach 10% of instant coffee - a devastating performance for sales of fresh coffee beans and fresh gourmet coffee. Lack of education and awareness about how to appreciate and brew a cup at home were the reasons behind the lagging volumes of fresh coffee. Consumers have a general misconception that fresh coffee is much more expensive than instant coffee, which is not true. A 200g pack of Boncafé Gourmet fresh coffee beans retails at RM13, which is the same as fresh ground coffee, while 200g of Boncafé instant Colombian coffee retails at RM18 and Mocha at RM28. </p>
<p>The expensive unit prices of coffee machines has limited their adoption in Malaysia in the past. However, there was an increasing trend of coffee machine sales from 2005-2010, with value sales up 7% in 2010 alone, as consumers grow more accustomed to the fresh coffee brewing process.</p>
<p>Another hindrance was the lack of media communication between players and their target audiences. Instant coffee advertisements were plentiful but there were few for fresh coffee brands. Many companies purely sell machines through offices and with no outlets to present and demonstrate these products or their usage, at home consumer penetration of coffee machines was limited. However, companies such as Barista Coffee have since actively promoted the art of brewing at home and enjoying fresh gourmet coffee outside the café.   The trend seems now to be here to stay with Hong Kong celebrities endorsing freshly brewed gourmet coffee via TV programmes such as “Coffee Confidential with Moses Chan”.</p>
<h2>Education and barista training initiatives</h2>
<p>Fresh coffee sales are expected to grow with groups of coffee elites or enthusiasts keen to promote gourmet coffee in the country. The Illy University of Coffee Malaysia (Università del caffè della Malesia), an institute for theoretical and practical training on coffee, aims to increase and disseminate the coffee culture to another level. This was the first step to improving education and awareness of the coffee culture. With more graduates who are well trained in this line, they will be able to help shape the gourmet coffee experience in Malaysia. </p>
<p>Companies such as Boncafé sell presentable ranges of coffee machines for home other than for commercial usage. Boncafé opened its first Être Bon Gallery and Academy in Kuala Lumpur in July 2010. Stores such as this facilitated customer interaction, which had previously been limited. Consumers will need more of these kids of coffee education initiatives in order to learn how to use these machines, chat about coffee beans and appreciate that they are not alone in experiencing gourmet coffee at home. Such outlets will in turn help operators to generate sales of their fresh coffee and other complementary products.</p>
<h2>Target a rising middle class</h2>
<p>The long term outlook is rosy thanks to all the current initiatives in place, which should shape a better environment for fresh coffee. The group of middle to high income earners of professionals and business leaders who travel will begin more and more to demand good quality Italian-style coffee. </p>
<p>As such, marketing strategies will become more sophisticated and varied between players. For instance, players such as Boncafé have already partnered with luxury property developers in the VIP launch of Seri Pilmoor Super Luxury Homes. Boncafé gourmet coffee was served throughout the event to the affluent VIPs.</p>
<p>To date, the weakness could be in the future supply of gourmet coffee, as currently brands such as Nespresso's capsules can only be purchased online. Nespresso machines can be bought via retail through its Singapore counterpart, although this facility is not yet available in the country. Malaysians currently more frequently buy these machines from overseas trips and bring them back home. However, such limitations in supply and a lack of physical outlets selling gourmet coffee in the country may deter consumers. Thus, increasing the choice of quality coffee machines and grinders, the supply of good baristas, and a wider choice of gourmet fresh coffee products will be the keys to developing the gourmet coffee culture.</p>

What Does the Kraft Foods Split Mean for Its Coffee Businesses? - Part One,"Kraft Foods Inc surprised many observers with the August 2011 announcement that they would split into two companies: one focused on slow growing but steady revenue North American products, and one focused on higher growth international snacks and confectionery brands.

While the majority of Kraft's business lies within packaged foods, the company is also the largest fresh coffee producer in the world.  In the first of a three-part series, Euromonitor International examines the implications of the coming 2012 split for its coffee sales and the situation faced by its Maxwell House-led US coffee portfolio.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The 2010-2011 period has been a transformative one for Kraft Foods.  In 2010, Kraft sold its North American frozen pizza business to Nestlé for US$3.7 billion.  Early in the year they completed a nearly US$20 billion purchase of Cadbury.  In March 2011, Starbucks ended its 12 year grocery distribution arrangement with Kraft, creating a vacancy for Kraft in the fast growing premium coffee space.  Now, the pending split of Kraft's North American grocery portfolio will create further disruption for the company in the short term.</p>
<p>Even with this upheaval, Kraft Foods has a solid global hot drinks brand portfolio. Labels such as Jacobs, Maxwell House, Carte Noire and Tassimo enjoy a high profile and occupy leading positions in core markets.  Kraft's position in coffee sales is threatened from ever intensifying competition, however, and the two new Kraft companies will need to take different approaches to meet this challenge.</p>
<h2>Maxwell House offers steady but slowing sales in the US</h2>
<p>Kraft's primary brand in North America is Maxwell House, a low priced coffee that had well over US$1 billion in global sales in 2010, according to Euromonitor International data.  However, growth in popularity of coffee pods in the US market, Kraft's single most important in fresh coffee, has weighed down on Maxwell House's growth in recent years.</p>
<p>The US is expected to post the strongest growth in the world in fresh coffee from 2010-2015, with sales expanding by US$2.2 billion. Despite a difficult economic environment, few in the US seem to be willing to trade down to economy coffee. The only compromise many are willing to make is to brew their coffee at home and reduce on-trade consumption. The increased penetration of fresh coffee sold in coffee pods has corresponded with this trend. Coffee pods' value share of fresh coffee sales increased by 2.9 percentage points to reach 6.6% in 2010. </p>
<h2>Loss of Starbucks represents a serious blow to US coffee sales</h2>
<p>Kraft's key battle may be in US fresh coffee where it has lost its licensing agreement with Starbucks. Starbucks subsequently agreed in March 2011 to a strategic alliance with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) whose Keurig K-Cup single cup brewing system is the leading coffee pod brand in the US. Kraft's own Tassimo system has not fared as well in the US market, with less than 4% of coffee pod sales. </p>
<p>By partnering with the market leader, Starbucks has secured wider distribution for its own pods. GMCR has secured yet another brand to add to its growing list of partners. The company has already purchased its major licensees including Tully's Coffee, Timothy's Coffees of the World and Diedrich. The Folgers and Twinings brands also produce K-Cups for use with the Keurig system. Dunkin Donuts has similarly launched a series of K-Cups in 2011.   It is likely that other brands will now herd behind the Keurig brewing system in an effort to maximise their own distribution.</p>
<p>The loss of Starbucks is blow on two fronts for Kraft. Firstly, the brand was its strongest position in premium fresh coffee. Its Maxwell House is a mid-range brand and the company lacks any other strong presence in this segment. Secondly, the loss of Starbucks tied exclusively to the Tassimo system will be a further negative against the Tassimo brand. </p>
<p>In addition, Kraft faces stiff competition from rival Nestlé with its Nespresso and more recently Nescafé Dolce Gusto systems in the coffee pod category. These brands have found success as the leading premium pod coffee platform in Western Europe, and are quickly expanding their presence in the US.</p>
<h2>Gevalia not enough</h2>
<p>Soon after the demise of the Starbucks partnership, Kraft announced that it would be launching its Gevalia brand into retail outlets in the US.  Gevalia is a premium coffee line sold for more than 25 years through internet and mail order distribution.  Kraft has subsequently announced a delay of this rollout to January 2012, allowing further time for coffee pods and rival premium coffees to gain standing with consumers.  </p>
<p>While it is true that the majority of growth from 2005-2010 in US retail coffee sales has come from premium priced brands, the most popular of these are connected to well recognized names, typically from leading coffee specialist chains like Starbucks, Caribou, Dunkin Donuts, and Seattle's Best.  Gevalia does not have nearly the same familiarity to most US consumers, and will likely not approach the more than US$700 million in retail sales enjoyed by Starbucks coffee in 2010.</p>
<h2>Additional premium coffee options</h2>
<p>Kraft could look to replace the gap left by Starbucks in premium fresh coffee through acquisition. One of the clearest potential targets would be Peet's, a super-premium regional coffee player with a strong West Coast base. With the company's limited distribution, a national player such as Kraft could significantly boost its presence. It would also give back Kraft a strongly followed brand in the premium segment. </p>
<p>In the US market, a Kraft/Peet's partnership would face strong competition in the Eastern US in particular where Peet's is particularly weak in terms of distribution. Kraft could look to increase the profile of the brand by entering into a similar agreement to the ones established by Starbucks with various on-trade food retailers such as Subway and Burger King. However, following the Cadbury acquisition, Kraft's appetite and ability to make further acquisitions is limited. Peets's total revenues for the year ending 2 January 2011 stood at US$333 million. </p>
<p>An alternative to acquiring Peet's would be to build the profile for the Carte Noire brand in the US market. This premium brand generates most of its sales in the French market. It is currently available only in the US as part of the T-Discs line-up for the Tassimo system.  With the pending migration of this brand into the second Kraft international company, it is unclear how quickly this option could now be pursued, but in the longer term a licensing agreement could prove beneficial, especially if Carte Noire's presence is further developed in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and beyond.  Part two of this series will examine this and other international strategies for Kraft's remaining coffee portfolio.</p>

But the move will have implications for a more diverse coffee strategy as well.  In part two of a three part series, Euromonitor International examines prospects and possible directions for Kraft's international coffee brands, now that they will be free of a challenging North American competitive environment.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>International coffee sales have high growth prospects</h2>
<p>Kraft remains strongest in the Western European market. In 2010, of its total sales in hot drinks, Western Europe made up 42% of value sales. However it has grown its position in Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific. These regions respectively made up 21% and 20% respectively of total Kraft sales in 2010. Hot drinks in these regions will see growth of 6.1% and 4.5% CAGR respectively. </p>
<p>Kraft is notably weak in Latin America, however, where hot drinks will see sales expand in absolute value terms by US$2 billion. Kraft's key global competitor Nestlé is the market leader in this region. Its Nescafé brand is the number one brand in hot drinks.</p>
<h2>Nestlé and Kraft compete for similar markets</h2>
<p>The Russian market was Kraft's top performer over the 2005-2010 period, with its coffee sales there growing by US$337 million during that time. Kraft is ranked number two overall behind Nestlé, the company's key competitor at the global level as well. Nestlé out-ranked Kraft in instant coffee and on this basis claimed the leading position overall. </p>
<p>However, as Russians move to fresh coffee, which itself is expected to grow by US$278 million through 2015, Kraft should look to invest in marketing for its Carte Noire and Jacobs brands, which are present here.  A move by Russian consumers towards more premium coffees is anticipated to drive much of the future growth in fresh coffee sales there.</p>
<p>Both companies drew considerable gains from many of the same markets. For both companies, France ranks as the number two market in terms of incremental growth over the 2005-2010 period. France is a less price-sensitive market than Russia and both companies have focused here on their more premium offer - Nespresso for Nestlé and Carte Noire for Kraft. </p>
<h2>Instant coffee threat in key markets</h2>
<p>Kraft may find itself in a weakened position in the short term as Nestlé with its stronger position in instant benefits from an uplift in sales in that category in several developing markets. While Nestlé will face considerable challenges in markets such as the US due to the launch of Starbucks Via, in the emerging markets in particular the landscape lends itself well to a positive performance in instant. </p>
<p>While this trend is most striking in Russia, other emerging markets including China will also see instant outperform fresh. History suggests, however, that as these markets mature, as disposable incomes grow and as café culture emerges, so too will a migration to fresh coffee. </p>
<p>In the Chinese market, while instant coffee will easily outstrip fresh in terms of absolute value growth, in CAGR terms, fresh coffee is set to grow at a faster pace. Both Russia and China have traditionally been tea-drinking nations and while coffee is now a standard part of daily life, in China the category remains marginal compared with tea value sales. These preferences will take some time to change. Tea is predicted to grow in China by US$2.4 billion, while coffee overall is expected to expand by US$371 million over the 2010-2015 period. </p>
<p>For Kraft, the emerging markets should be its main priority going forward. In the mature markets, however, the company will face challenges mainly due to the changing nature of coffee consumption related to coffee pods in the German and French markets, which it will need to overcome. In instant coffee in some of these areas, the company could also face a challenge from Starbucks Via, as this premium single serve instant coffee expands its global distribution. Starbucks' UK and US launch of 'premium' instant coffee has already extended in 2011 to all of that company's Asia Pacific markets, and will likely be copied elsewhere if the product continues to prove successful.</p>
<h2>Consider replicating Via success in Russia</h2>
<p>Kraft could follow the example set by Starbucks in the US market and build a niche for itself as a 'premium' instant coffee producer by introducing a line of single-serve instant coffee sachets and expanding this to include flavours and decaffeinated varieties. This would suit Russians looking for a quick cup, while outside of the home. </p>
<p>Given that the Maxwell House range has virtually no profile in the Russian market and given the Jacobs brand contributes less to Kraft's Russian sales than Carte Noire, it should consider launching this under the Jacobs brand. This would help to increase Jacobs's sales without creating any confusion among Carte Noire customers. The Jacobs brand is also already available in the instant category in this market. </p>
<p>There is a clear and growing interest in more premium instant coffees in Russia. While Nestlé is the clear market leader with a share of 33%, there continue to be a number of smaller local players as well as 21% of sales attributable to others. This suggests considerable scope for growth for Kraft. </p>
<p>In the UK market in 2011, Kraft launched Kenco Millicano Wholebean Instant, made from finely-milled Arabica beans and promising a ground coffee flavour with the convenience of instant. While the Kenco brand is not available in Russia, a similar product could be launched under the Jacobs brand, which is already recognised as an instant brand. </p>
<h2>Fill in global gaps, starting with Latin America</h2>
<p>Latin America is a blind spot for Kraft. It lacks any significant presence here and is absent from the Brazilian coffee market entirely. This will present problems for the company in the future given that sales of hot drinks there are expected to grow by US$974 million over 2010-2015, representing a CAGR of 3%. Fresh ground coffee is set to lead growth, expanding by US$637 billion. </p>
<p>Brazil will dominate regional growth. Of total fresh coffee growth, 66% will be attributed to Brazil. Sara Lee and Nestlé are the market leaders here in coffee, with shares of 18% and 11% respectively in 2010. Kraft, however, is strong in the region in other categories including confectionery. The company should consider leveraging its distribution network to grow its sales in Brazil.  For example, this is one area where a premium coffee pod platform like Tassimo could still carve out a significant share. Coffee pods accounted for only 0.4% of coffee sales in the region in 2010.</p>
<p>Opportunities still exist in Brazil for Kraft to enter particularly given that brand shares remain fairly fragmented. The others category made up 43% of retail value sales, suggesting considerable room to capture market share. Given that fresh coffee is expected to post the strongest growth in hot drinks in the region, it is here where the company should focus its efforts. The company could take a similar route to Sara Lee, ranked number three globally in coffee, and acquire a local producer as it did in November 2010 with Café Damasco.</p>
<p>Kraft's ability to pursue bolt-on acquisitions or strategic partnerships like this might be limited in 2011-2012 as the company finalises its separation, but in the meantime its competitors will not sit idly by.  The new international Kraft should be in a better position in the longer term to develop its global coffee sales, but will likely find itself slipping further behind until then.</p>

Euromonitor is just reading the tea leaves, or in this case, the coffee beans.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>What Kraft has already said</h2>
<p>Kraft has stated the goal of the break-up of the company is to enhance investor value in the short term as quickly as possible.  The break-up will create two separate companies with very different business models.  The North American company will be slow growth but generate a rich dividend for investors.  The focus of this company will be on distributing products that are sold in the centre of the grocery store.  Coffee is a good strategic fit with this strategy in North America.</p>
<p>Outside North America the company will focus on the high growth categories of confectionery and snacking.  Presumably this means that more profit will be reinvested in the business to grow at a faster pace for the investor looking for profitability growth.  These products are primarily sold in the front of the grocery store and are available for immediate consumption.  While outside the US, as discussed in part two of this series, Kraft's coffee brands have good growth prospects, coffee does not look like it fits too well with the distribution aspect of this business model. </p>
<p>So it looks like Kraft is telling us that their coffee business outside the US is likely to go the way of their frozen pizza business; for sale to the highest bidder.  This would generate additional funds to be invested in and accelerate the growth of the core growth businesses of the international company.</p>
<p>To help maximize value it would be helpful if several companies were interested in bidding for Kraft's coffee business.  Fortunately for Kraft, there are several potential contenders that would benefit from acquiring Kraft's coffee business.</p>
<h2>Potential contenders for Kraft's international coffee business</h2>
<p>The list of interested parties may be long and distinguished.  Three companies that come immediately to mind are Nestlé, Sara Lee and Tata Global Beverages.  Nestle may be the most likely because of its financial strength.  While a good strategic fit for both Sara Lee and Tata, they may not have the financing for a deal.</p>
<p>Although Nestlé is the retail leader in coffee based on both value and volume, they do not have a mid/premium priced trademark.  Nestle has an economical instant coffee business, Nescafé, and super-premium pod business, Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, with nothing in between.  Kraft's fresh coffee business could prove highly incremental by filling a missing mid-level tier in Nestlé's coffee portfolio.</p>
<p>For Sara Lee, Kraft's portfolio expands their geographic footprint.  Although the combined coffee business would catapult Sara Lee past Nestle into the #1 position based on volume, the combined Sara Lee/Kraft would remain #2 based on value.  A big benefit for Sara Lee is that Kraft generally is strong where Sara Lee is weak.  Even in Western Europe, where Kraft/Sara Lee would be #1 in both value and volume sales (beating Nestle), the two companies are strong in different countries.  The key issue for Sara Lee is whether or not they would have the financial strength to complete an acquisition; Kraft's coffee business outside North America is US$6.6bn. in 2010, about twice the size of Sara Lee.</p>
<p>A third potential bidder for Kraft's coffee business is Tata Global Beverages.  The company has been looking to expand in the beverage arena.  Kraft's international coffee would complement their mainly tea business.  Similar to Sara Lee, Kraft's coffee business generates significantly greater revenue than Tata's beverage business.  However since they are privately owned and the new coffee brands would be a good fit with their beverage portfolio, they may be able to tap into support from the broader Tata enterprise.</p>
<p>After splitting the company, Kraft is likely to still have one more deal before they are done executing a plan they hope will deliver the most shareholder value in the shortest amount of time.</p>

Thailand - The World’s Most Dynamic Instant Coffee Market,"Asia-Pacific has been the largest market for instant coffee for many years.  Additionally, over the past five years, Asia-Pacific has also been the highest growth region for instant coffee, with retail volume growing 49% from 2005-2010.  The Asia-Pacific region accounted for two thirds of global retail volume growth over this time period.","<h2>Thailand has had sustained rapid growth in its coffee market</h2>
<p>Thailand has been the most dynamic market in the world's most dynamic instant coffee region.   From 2005-2010 Thailand grew retail volume by more than three times the next closest country, accounting for over one in four tonnes of incremental global volume.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific has been the largest market for instant coffee for many years.

The Asia-Pacific region accounted for two thirds of global retail volume growth over this time period.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Thailand has always had a coffee drinking culture.  In 2010, retail value sales of coffee were more than ten times those of tea.  The overwhelming majority of coffee sales is for the instant coffee category.  One obvious characteristic in favour of instant coffee is its convenience.  Thai income growth has helped to make instant coffee affordable to more people.  Since 2000, Thai per capita disposable income has grown by 50% on a constant basis; almost as fast as India's per capita disposable income growth.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Vietnam have a similar situation to Thailand.  These markets also have a coffee consuming culture and rapidly increasing incomes.  The percentage growth rate in these countries is actually greater than Thailand but since they are starting from a lower base, the absolute growth is less.  The rest of this article will focus on innovation in Thailand but the same principles also apply to Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Per Capita Disposable Income 2000-2015</h4>
<p>Constant 2010 US$<img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\56691dc1-9bef-475f-8302-d03b01700fc0.PNG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h2>Recent innovations are maintaining growth</h2>
<p>Convenience was sufficient in the past for rapid growth of instant coffee.  The most common type of instant coffee in Thailand, comprising over 65% of instant coffee value sales, is 3-in-1 with creamer and sweetener already included.  However, to maintain the same growth rate, recently there was also more creative product innovation that is likely to continue into the future. </p>
<p>As instant coffee drinking has gained in prominence, there is an increasing focus on incorporating health and wellness benefits into products.   Thai consumers, women in particular, are concerned about attaining and maintaining a healthy looking body shape and to meet this consumer need manufacturers innovated with instant coffee products that contain additional additives to enhance the digestive system or reduce cholesterol levels. Fibre, white beans, collagen, and L-carnitine are the most popular ingredients. </p>
<p>Several new brands were initially launched by smaller manufacturers in 2008.  These brands, Nature Gift, Fitné and Body Shape demonstrated that there could be a demand for products with added benefits. Body Shape is typical of these innovative products.  It is a weight management coffee targeted at health conscious adults.  It contains Collagen, Neopuntia, L-Carnitine and CLA.  The other products have different ingredients but are targeted at a similar audience.</p>
<p>Responding to theses currently niche products, to protect their future position in the category, leading multi-national brands Nescafé from Nestlé SA (with a 58% retail volume share of instant coffee sales in 2010) and Moccona from Sara Lee Corp (with a 4% retail volume share in 2010) each introduced line extensions of the core trademarks that added functional ingredients, Nescafé Protect Pro Slim and Moccona Trio Plus.</p>
<p>Nescafé Protect Pro Slim contains white bean extract, which is a good source for lowering cholesterol and blood sugar, 3,000 mg fibre to improve digestive system, and Corogenic Acid for an antioxidant effect. The company has heavily invested in communicating the benefits of this product through online marketing via its own website, social networks and product sampling.</p>
<p>In 2009, Sara Lee introduced Moccona Trio Plus which is positioned as a healthy 3-in-1 coffee.  Moccona Trio Plus comes in two different varieties; Cal Plus with added calcium to target male consumers and Moccona Trio Plus In Shape with white bean extract to reduce carbohydrate absorption and contains less sugar which targets women.  Sara Lee set the pricing of the line of Moccona Trio Plus products at a lower price than Nescafé Protect Proslim in recognition of its weaker share position and lower advertising budget.</p>
<h2>Implications for other Asia-Pacific countries</h2>
<p>The key dynamics that have driven instant coffee growth historically in Thailand are predicted to continue in the future.  These two dynamics are increasing wealth enabling consumption of a convenient-to-prepare version of coffee (3-in-1 is the most popular variant) and creative health claims.</p>
<p>While the health claims made in Thailand may be difficult to make outside Asia because of a more restrictive regulatory environment, there are other countries in Asia that are experiencing similar income growth and have a cultural preference for coffee.  Indonesia and Vietnam are two other countries that may have similar dynamics to Thailand that bode well for the growth of instant coffee in Asia.</p>

Smoothies by Starbucks: Is fresh juice the future of America’s favourite coffee chain?,"With the acquisition of US$30 million juice brand Evolution Fresh, Starbucks announced plans to leverage the company into a multi-billion-dollar health and wellness business.","<p>With the acquisition of US$30 million juice brand Evolution Fresh, Starbucks announced plans to leverage the company into a multi-billion-dollar health and wellness business.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>While diversification into juice and smoothies is a surprising move, there have long been signs Starbucks might be looking to broaden its reach, the most telling having been the recent removal of the word “coffee” from its logo. What remains to be seen, however, is exactly how this new venture will play out. The idea of applying Starbucks' lifestyle-based branding strategy to other beverage concepts is an interesting one, and anyone who is unequivocally sceptical of the idea would be advised to take a closer look at Starbucks' track record. However, there are also sizable risks involved, including significant capital expenditure, the threat of competition in a market with few barriers to entry and even the cannibalisation of sales from Starbucks coffee outlets.</p>
<h2>A new billion-dollar brand</h2>
<p>Starbucks' strategy is three-pronged, involving foodservice, retail and an eventual foray into the larger health and wellness industry. As its first step, Starbucks plans to integrate ready-to-drink (RTD) Evolution Fresh products into existing Starbucks outlets, spreading awareness of the new brand and serving as a de-facto endorsement. Simultaneously, the company will also begin building a national consumer packaged goods business with Evolution Fresh products in the grocery store channel. The company applied a similar strategy successfully with the launch of VIA Ready Brew in 2009, claiming 14% of instant coffee retail value (RSP) sales in the US just one year after its launch.</p>
<p>Where the plan diverges significantly is in prong three: By mid-2012, Starbucks plans to begin opening proprietary juice bar outlets offering wholesome beverages and foods. According to the company, Starbucks' long-term goal for their health and wellness business is to maintain national distribution of Evolution Fresh products to Starbucks stores, national distribution for the products through the consumer packaged goods channel, and a national footprint of foodservice outlets for the new juice bar concept.</p>
<h3>Why juice?</h3>
<p>At first glance, the choice to enter juice/smoothie bars may seem like an odd one. US value growth in the category has been slowing since 2007, and sales actually declined 3% from 2009 to 2010. Total US volume of off-trade fruit/vegetable juice has been declining since 2007, with an absolute decrease of 363 million litres over three years. The US volume of not from concentrate 100% juice, which includes brands ranging from mass-market orange juice to premium smoothies, has been trending similarly, falling 3% from 2009 to 2010. Even Jamba Juice, the current leader in US juice/smoothie bars with a 42% market share, recorded a 3% drop in value sales and a 3% drop in transactions in 2010, despite outlet numbers remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>These figures beg the question, what makes Starbucks think this initiative will succeed? In the company's own words, its optimism hinges on the utilization of Starbucks' considerable assets, growing consumer interest in healthy juice products and Evolution Fresh's unique pasteurization process. In a recent conference call, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz highlighted select independent juice/smoothie bars as models for Evolution Fresh's future positioning. These stores have a heavy health and wellness positioning and a loyal, local following, catering to the idea of juice and smoothies as meal replacements, healthy alternatives and wellness cleanses. According to Schultz, the most successful of these outlets do upwards of US$1 million in sales per year, significantly higher than Jamba Juice's 2010 average sales per outlet of US$656,000. </p>
<p>Also according to Schultz, Starbucks believes it can mimic the success of these independent stores on a national scale, with the quality of Evolution Fresh products serving as the key to their differentiation. Evolution Fresh uses a proprietary process called High-Pressure Pasteurization, which pasteurizes fresh juice without using heat, lengthening the product's shelf life while keeping micronutrients and enzymes intact. As one of the only juice companies in the market to offer this health-based benefit, Schultz believes the brand is uniquely suited to serve the growing faction of health and wellness-motivated juice customers. More specifically, Starbucks believes this process will set the brand apart from other RTD brands such as Naked Juice (PepsiCo) and Odwalla (Coca-Cola).</p>
<p>In larger foodservice trends, the idea of a hip, lifestyle-oriented juice bar aligns well with many of the larger movements currently in play in US foodservice, including health and wellness, foodservice as an affordable indulgence and an upgraded dining experience. A juice bar concept that addresses all of these factors, combined with an upscale outlet format, could be well-positioned to ride these trends to future success.</p>
<h4>High risk, high reward</h4>
<p>While the near-term potential benefits are clear—Starbucks will now have US$1.2 billion in juice/smoothie bars value to compete for, plus the US$320 million in retail sales of not from concentrate 100% juice not currently claimed by private label brands and mass-market brands Tropicana, Simply, Florida's Natural and Citrus World Donald Duck—the drawbacks are also numerous. Building a new concept is expensive, and as Evolution Fresh is such a small company, the brand will likely require the injection of considerable capital before national distribution becomes feasible.  Furthermore, that US$320 million in Starbucks' best-case-scenario addressable retail market share is only growing smaller, declining from a recent high of US$343 in 2008. Furthermore, of that US$320 million, US$220 million was claimed by Coca-Cola's Odwalla in 2010, evidence of the depth of the brand's current penetration into Starbuck's new target category. </p>
<p>Where Starbucks does maintain a sizable advantage, however, is in its ability to distribute the brand through Starbucks outlets. Starbucks has the capability to immediately roll out Evolution Fresh products to 12,000 US stores, leveraging a built-in traffic flow and up-selling by baristas to encourage maximum consumer uptake of the new brand. Arguably, this area is where Starbucks should have the most success with the new venture: Selling Evolution Fresh products in existing outlets will improve the beverage offering at Starbucks stores, encourage incremental sales and higher average checks, and add an additional revenue stream for the company as it expands its supplier role.</p>
<p>This constant exposure to Starbucks' existing consumer base will also give the brand an edge in achieving its next goal of national distribution through the grocery store channel. In that arena, Starbucks will have to compete with the giants of the beverage industry for share in what is already a relatively saturated RTD market, and making sure Starbucks consumers already have a strong connection to the brand may give Evolution Fresh enough of an advantage to compete successfully with  much larger companies and their considerable influence.</p>
<p>Looking next at the possible success of Starbucks' new concept stores, the fundamental questions here are, do US consumers want to stop into foodservice outlets for premium juice blends, and if so, do they have the time, income and inclination to add another daily ritual to their busy schedules? The recent success of real fruit smoothies in fast food has shown the answer to the former is a resounding yes; however, this also brings up the issue of foodservice competition. With operators across fast food scrambling to add smoothies to menus—not to mention the presence of dedicated juice/smoothie bars players—consumers are hardly at a loss for options. Similarly, foodservice outlets in the US have recently been moving away from specialization and toward the idea that outlets should fulfil all of a consumer's daily food needs, from breakfast through late-night snacks. Even Starbucks worked to improve its food offering this year with the launch of Bistro Box lunches, and Jamba Juice has recently focused on menu innovation, adding a line of frozen yogurt and customisable toppings soon to launch nation-wide.</p>
<p>Moving on to the second question, this is where the outlook starts to look a little more tenuous. Assuming Starbucks can work its magic to sell consumers on the idea of a daily juice habit, where does this new ritual fit into consumers' lives? It seems likely that the segment of the population that would be most receptive to this idea (young, health-minded consumers in urban areas) is already counted among Starbucks' target market. These consumers may be convinced to trade their afternoon skim latté for a fresh carrot juice, but significant incremental business seems unlikely. This has left some wondering why Starbucks didn't opt instead to simply incorporate the Evolution Fresh brand into existing Starbucks menus, adding a health and wellness element to the chain's existing positioning. McDonald's has seen incredible success with this strategy with its McCafé menu in the US; the company incorporated the new line into existing stores, reaping all of the benefits of the new positioning without the added cost of outlet expansion.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, Starbucks is clearly venturing into uncharted territory, and the company will face many threats as it moves forward with the growth of Evolution Fresh. But potential pitfalls aside, Starbucks' company history is littered with such unlikely successes, from the $3 cup of coffee, to the blended Frappuccino and, more recently, VIA instant coffee. As such it's entirely possible the smoothie concept will join these ranks, marking yet another win for the formidable coffee giant.</p>

This makes the coffee itself more premium than other brands.  In South Korea the Instant Coffee category also has a premium trend but accomplishing this by adding premium additives that complement the instant coffee.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>South Korea – one of the larger instant coffee with additives markets</h2>
<p>Instant coffee in South Korea has made a major effort to simplify its ease of preparation.  Originally there was instant coffee and consumers typically added their own sugar and creamer.  To make the process more convenient manufacturers added the sugar and creamer to the coffee, eliminating a step for preparation.  2-in-1 instant coffee includes the coffee and either a sweetener or a creamer.  3-in-1 includes both the sweetener and the creamer.  Of the different types of instant coffee with added ingredients, 3-in-1 is the most popular globally.  Other additives in addition to the sweetener and creamer include functional additives such as ginseng (4-in-1) or flavourings such as cappuccino or mocha (specialty).  In South Korea, among instant coffee with added ingredients the 3-in-1 type is the most popular comprising about 50% of the total retail value in 2010 followed by specialty Italian varieties (that contain sweetener, creamer and cappuccino or mocha, etc. flavourings) that are about 26% of total retail value.</p>
<p>Although Russia leads the world in retail value of instant coffee in 2010 with over US$2,700mn., South Korea leads the world in the value sales of instant coffee with additives (in-1's instant coffee) with sales over US$600mn.  </p>
<h2>Adding value through ingredients that compliment coffee</h2>
<p>South Korea leads the world largely due to its leading position in 3-in-1 instant coffee, owning 17% of global retail value of this segment in 2010 and its number two position in 2-in-1 instant coffee where it enjoys a 12% share of the segment.   Since 2007 retail value increased by US$108mn (an 8% compound annual growth rate).  South Korea is interesting because driving this increase is a trend to more premium products.  New products were introduced that contained higher quality creamer and sugar. As a result of these efforts, coffee was upgraded with a wider range of premium products, resulting in an average unit price increase.</p>
<p>Although 3-in-1 has the largest share of instant coffee with added ingredients in South Korea, its value share continued to decrease in 2010 to fall to 59% from 64% in 2007. This is partly because of the growing consumer concerns about health in general and weight management in particular. Thus, manufacturers have introduced half calorie products, which fall under 2-in-1 instant coffee as they do not include a creamer.  For example, Kraft Foods, the leading manufacturer, extended their number one brand with the line extension Maxim Well-Being 1/2 calories, which has no creamer, a sugar substitute and reduces the calorie content by one half. Also, premium 4-in-1 mixes containing healthy ingredients were introduced in 2010.</p>
<p>To break the consumer perception that instant coffee is unhealthy, manufacturers have tried to upgrade product quality. These efforts attracted more consumers and helped instant coffee to maintain healthy retail sales growth.  </p>
<p>3-in-1 instant coffee is predicted to continue to dominate, although 4-in-1 instant coffee is likely to emerge as a significant format in the forecast period. In 2009, the launch of Coffee Bean Coffee Mix, including ginseng, allowed consumers to experience 4-in-1 instant coffee. Manufacturers added nutritional ingredients to instant coffee as a means of differentiation, and this trend is likely to expand in the forecast period.</p>
<h2>Implications for other markets</h2>
<p>South Korea is moving beyond common additives to simplify preparation to premium creamers and sweeteners as well as functional additives.  This is a different way of adding value to the instant coffee drinking experience.  </p>
<p>There are several larger instant coffee markets such as Russia, Japan, UK and Germany that have a small in-1's business.  Perhaps innovation in common additives will grow the category or allow for more upscale pricing.  Manufacturers might try organic sugar and creamers from all natural ingredients in addition to anti-oxidant additives to expand and add value to the category.</p>

Euromonitor is just reading the tea leaves, or in this case, the coffee beans.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>What Kraft has already said</h3>
<p>Kraft has stated the goal of the break-up of the company is to enhance investor value in the short term as quickly as possible. The break-up will create two separate companies with very different business models. The North American company will be slow growth but generate a rich dividend for investors. The focus of this company will be on distributing products that are sold in the centre of the grocery store. Coffee is a good strategic fit with this strategy in North America.</p>
<p>Outside North America the company will focus on the high growth categories of confectionery and snacking. Presumably this means that more profit will be reinvested in the business to grow at a faster pace for the investor looking for profitability growth. These products are primarily sold in the front of the grocery store and are available for immediate consumption. While outside the US, as discussed in part two of this series, Kraft's coffee brands have good growth prospects, coffee does not look like it fits too well with the distribution aspect of this business model. </p>
<p>So it looks like Kraft is telling us that their coffee business outside the US is likely to go the way of their frozen pizza business; for sale to the highest bidder. This would generate additional funds to be invested in and accelerate the growth of the core growth businesses of the international company.</p>
<p>To help maximize value it would be helpful if several companies were interested in bidding for Kraft's coffee business. Fortunately for Kraft, there are several potential contenders that would benefit from acquiring Kraft's coffee business.</p>
<h3>Potential contenders for Kraft's international coffee business</h3>
<p>The list of interested parties may be long and distinguished. Three companies that come immediately to mind are Nestlé, Sara Lee and Tata Global Beverages. Nestle may be the most likely because of its financial strength. While a good strategic fit for both Sara Lee and Tata, they may not have the financing for a deal.</p>
<p>Although Nestlé is the retail leader in coffee based on both value and volume, they do not have a mid/premium priced trademark. Nestle has an economical instant coffee business, Nescafé, and super-premium pod business, Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, with nothing in between. Kraft's fresh coffee business could prove highly incremental by filling a missing mid-level tier in Nestlé's coffee portfolio.</p>
<p>For Sara Lee, Kraft's portfolio expands their geographic footprint. Although the combined coffee business would catapult Sara Lee past Nestle into the #1 position based on volume, the combined Sara Lee/Kraft would remain #2 based on value. A big benefit for Sara Lee is that Kraft generally is strong where Sara Lee is weak. Even in Western Europe, where Kraft/Sara Lee would be #1 in both value and volume sales (beating Nestle), the two companies are strong in different countries. The key issue for Sara Lee is whether or not they would have the financial strength to complete an acquisition; Kraft's coffee business outside North America is US$6.6bn. in 2010, about twice the size of Sara Lee.</p>
<p>A third potential bidder for Kraft's coffee business is Tata Global Beverages. The company has been looking to expand in the beverage arena. Kraft's international coffee would complement their mainly tea business. Similar to Sara Lee, Kraft's coffee business generates significantly greater revenue than Tata's beverage business. However since they are privately owned and the new coffee brands would be a good fit with their beverage portfolio, they may be able to tap into support from the broader Tata enterprise.</p>
<p>After splitting the company, Kraft is likely to still have one more deal before they are done executing a plan they hope will deliver the most shareholder value in the shortest amount of time.</p>

Sara Lee Looks to Europe With House of Coffee Purchase,"Sara Lee Corp announced in late November 2011 that it and its Norwegian partner Kaffehuset Friele would purchase ISS A/S' House of Coffee business.  House of Coffee distributes to the office, foodservice, and institutional coffee channels in Norway and Denmark.  Sara Lee has a minority 45% stake in Norwegian market leader Kaffehuset, and is looking for new ways to carry this partnership forward.","<p>Sara Lee Corp announced in late November 2011 that it and its Norwegian partner Kaffehuset Friele would purchase ISS A/S' House of Coffee business.  House of Coffee distributes to the office, foodservice, and institutional coffee channels in Norway and Denmark.  Sara Lee has a minority 45% stake in Norwegian market leader Kaffehuset, and is looking for new ways to carry this partnership forward.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Building position in coffee ahead of planned split</h2>
<p>The move represents an attempt to broaden Sara Lee's international coffee portfolio ahead of the planned split of its business in 2012.  Sara Lee will become two publicly traded companies: one focused on North American meats and foods, and the other on international beverages and bakery.  Sara Lee sold many of its North American coffee brands such as Hills Brothers and Chase & Sanborn to Segafredo Zanetti in 2004, and its Senseo coffee pod system remains much more successful in Western Europe than in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The acquisition of House of Coffee represents a strategic opportunity to eventually move Senseo and other brands further into office and away from home channels, building upon that brand's 2010 launch in Norway.  In the immediate future, Sara Lee and Kaffehuset will take on existing coffee vending arrangements with current House of Coffee customers in Norway and Denmark, inheriting a lineup of brands and access to customers that can form the basis for future expansion in these markets.</p>
<h2>Focus on Western Europe</h2>
<p>Western Europe remains a major market for Sara Lee.  The most valuable coffee brand for the company in terms of retail sales is Douwe Egberts, with US$673 million in retail sales in 2010. However, the brand with the greatest growth potential is clearly Senseo, which had reached sales of US$642 million by 2010. The geographic presence of the brand is still relatively limited and its full potential has thus not yet been reached. </p>
<p>Sara Lee has increasingly put its focus on the Senseo and Maison du Café ranges with a view to targeting markets like Germany with growing coffee pod sales. In that country, however, Sara Lee has had to contend with both a strong premium competitor in Nestlé's Nespresso and several private label coffee pod offerings as well.</p>
<p>In Norway, coffee is the number one “folkedrikke” (people's drink), and consumption according to the trade association Norsk Kaffeinformasjon is 9.5kg per person per year. Norwegian consumers drink coffee several times a day, both at home and in away from home locations.  Foodservice represents some 9-10% of all coffee sales in the country, and 900 million cups of coffee are sold and drunk at work places per year.</p>
<p>Even though Friele leads Norway retail coffee sales with a 30% value share in 2010, clearly there is also an opportunity for expansion with foodservice coffee.   Convenience stores such as Narvesen or 7-Eleven are found on almost every corner, and at subway stations and airports. 7-Eleven uses Friele as its coffee supplier already, and there is likely to be a further opportunity for expansion of premium Sara Lee brands into this area, with the House of Coffee resources helping the company to increase the relationship and service offered to foodservice operators and offices.</p>
<h2>Could Kraft partnership be on the horizon?  </h2>
<p>Sara Lee's increased focus on its Western European and international coffee businesses could put it at a strategic advantage in the years ahead as it streamlines its business units and pulls away from a saturated North American market.  Kraft is its main competitor and it too is in the midst of splitting its North American and international businesses in 2012.</p>
<p>Kraft comfortably takes the top spot in fresh coffee globally. Its key brands are Maxwell House, which generates most of its sales in North America, Jacobs, which generates most of its sales in Western and Eastern Europe, and Carte Noire, which relies heavily on sales in the French market. Though it has the lead in sales, Kraft's coffee businesses still rely on large, mature markets for the greatest proportion of sales, and the company's Tassimo pod system has not found as much traction in the marketplace as Nespresso and Senseo.  </p>
<p>Sara Lee takes the number two spot, with an 8% global market share. While the company is involved in fewer markets than Kraft, it does have the benefit of very strong positions in a number of the faster growing ones. It is the leader in the Brazilian and Dutch fresh coffee categories, as well taking the number three spot in France. Sara Lee's new international division will furthermore be able to focus on coffee as a key category, while Kraft's structure will still prioritize its larger confectionery and snacks businesses, impulse categories that fall under different locations in the store than coffee.  </p>
<p>As a result, Kraft could look to eventually dispose of its international coffees, with Maxwell House staying within the North American portfolio.  In such a scenario, Sara Lee could be a likely suitor, building upon its momentum of expansion into new channels and premium formats.  While House of Coffee represents the kind of strategic bolt-on acquisition Sara Lee will continue to purse now, the company is in a prime position for a larger impact as well. </p>

Private Label Coffee Potential in Eastern Europe,"Global private label coffee volume share stood at 11% in 2010, having risen slowly but steadily since 2005.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h2>Private Label -  Western Europe background</h2>
<p>Private label is a strong competitor mainly in the developed markets of Western Europe and North America, where fresh coffee has a strong presence. Its share in these regions, particularly in Western Europe, is also a function of the overall strength of private label in all food and beverage categories.</p>
<p>Western Europe features the highest private label share in the world, with several countries where private label coffees represent a quarter of the market or more.  A highly developed retail environment drives much of this competitive situation, with high profile discounters like Aldi featuring a majority of private label products in their stores.  Cultural acceptance of private label coffee also arises out of many decades of presence in the marketplace and, over time, demonstrating that the product quality is close to branded competitors.</p>
<h2>Gaining a toehold in Eastern Europe</h2>
<p>Private label coffees in other regions, like Eastern Europe, have made share gains in recent years, but cultural and retail distribution barriers mean that private label's share is unlikely to reach double digits in the near term.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe may be more indicative of how private label coffee sales will develop in the rest of the world. Only Slovakia had a private label coffee share above 10% in 2005. By 2010, private label had doubled its share in Croatia, while in Hungary it increased by four percentage points to 14%.</p>
<p>Once introduced, private label has shown potential for rapid success in the region.  The expansion of private label into fresh coffee and the continued development of chained supermarkets and large retailers will drive this growth.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that private label coffee in Eastern Europe will be able to achieve the near parity quality perceptions that it has achieved in Western Europe over the period of many years.  However, the retail barriers that have existed in the past are beginning to be eroded.</p>
<h2>Favourable developments in the retail environment</h2>
<p>In 2006 supermarkets plus hypermarkets plus discounters comprised only 39% of Eastern Europe grocery retail sales.  This lagged Western Europe by a full 30 percentage point.  By 2016 this gap between Eastern Europe and Western Europe in formats that are conducive to private label in general is forecasted to be cut in half with supermarkets plus hypermarkets plus discounters growing to 58% of grocery retail in Eastern Europe (Western Europe is forecasted to grow to 74% of retail grocery).</p>
<p>So the grocery retail environment in Eastern Europe is forecasted to rapidly transform to more closely resemble Western Europe.  However, Eastern European consumers do not have the same longstanding familiarity with private label purchasing as those in Western Europe, meaning that short-term potential is likely to be limited to volume shares in the 10-20% range, rather than 30% and above observed in Western Europe.</p>
<h2>Private Label may spur innovation from branded manufacturers</h2>
<p>If private label coffee is able to achieve the same quality perceptions that it has achieved in Western Europe, then there may be even greater potential.  In Western Europe private label coffee had over a 26% retail volume share in 2010.  Eastern Europe, with only a 3% share has considerable potential for not only short-term growth but for sustained growth into the medium-term.  Branded manufacturers, being aware of these developments, are likely to respond with improved product quality and innovation at an attractive price.  The consumer will be the big winner.</p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>One area in which Givaudan is active is tea and coffee flavours with its TasteEssentials Coffee and TasteEssentials Tea products. Tea and coffee flavour ingredients are particularly important in the ready-to-drink (RTD) tea and coffee categories, which are popular soft drinks in Asia. The biggest RTD coffee market in 2010 was Japan, accounting for a 75% volume share of global RTD coffee sales of 4.3 billion litres, while in the 28 billion litre RTD tea category China was by far the largest market with a 42% share. </p>
<p>Recognising the significant opportunities available to coffee flavours in Japan, Givaudan focused its attention on the country's RTD coffee category in 2010. By looking at the Japanese market it hopes to better understand the dynamics of the category, which it can then apply to other markets. </p>
<h3>Better opportunities elsewhere?</h3>
<p>However, while Japan may be the largest RTD coffee market, consumption of RTD coffee has been falling since 2009 and by 2015 the country is expected to account for 68% of the global market compared to the 75% share it held in 2010. Competition from other drinks, including tonic drinks, as well as consumers cutting down on discretionary spending will both have an effect on the market. Better growth opportunities for Givaudan may lie in other countries in the region, including China, which is forecast a CAGR of 15% over 2010-2015, South Korea (5%), Thailand (7%) and Australia (4%). </p>
<p>In addition, Givaudan will have to compete with Japanese flavours and fragrances company Takasago, which acquired the Malaysian coffee business Dan Kaffe in 2007. It supplies liquid coffee extracts for use in RTD coffee (as well as spray dried coffee and freeze dried coffee), which is well established in the Asian market. </p>

<p>Over 2011-2016 coffee is set to be the fastest growing of all hot drinks categories in every region except Asia Pacific and North America. In Asia Pacific, coffee retail value growth is projected to slightly trail that of tea (23% for coffee compared to 26% for tea in constant US$ terms). In North America, the tea category is growing from a much smaller base. Only around one dollar in tea retail value was generated for every five dollars in coffee in 2011. Over 2011-2016, tea is projected to grow by 13% compared to 9% for coffee.</p>
<h2>Convenience and premiumisation drive growth</h2>
<p>Coffee is gaining value in the tea-dominated region of Eastern Europe thanks to the instant coffee category which includes pre-measured amounts of creamer and sweetener. Although North America is a mature coffee market, the convenience and premium nature of the pod format, which has been growing in popularity in Western Europe for several years, is now generating excitement in North America.</p>
<p>In fact, coffee retail value in Eastern Europe surpassed that of North America in 2010. Over 2011-2016 Eastern Europe will increase its lead over North America in terms of coffee value sales, growing by US$2 billion compared to around US$1 billion for North America. Perhaps surprisingly, over 75% of coffee value growth is projected to come from Russia, traditionally a tea-drinking country. It is the convenience of the instant format that will be the main contributor to growth.</p>
<p>In the mature North American market coffee retail value in constant terms is projected to grow by only 9% over 2011-2016. However, over two-thirds of this growth is projected to come from pods, a category which is expected to achieve a 77% increase over this period. The growth of coffee pods is being driven not only by the convenience of preparing an individual cup of coffee but also by providing coffee house quality at home at a better price than in a foodservice outlet.</p>
<p>Fresh ground coffee pods will also drive future growth in Western Europe. As recently as 2006, fresh ground coffee pods accounted for just a 10% share of coffee retail value sales. By 2011, this share had risen to 21% and by 2016 coffee pods are expected to command a 26% share of coffee value. Over 2011-2016, coffee pods will account for around 75% of coffee value growth. Clearly, the convenience and quality of this relatively new format can be perceived as a value-added addition to a mature coffee category by consumers in developed markets. </p>
<h2>Rising incomes in developing markets also contribute to growth</h2>
<p>In Latin America, coffee is the dominant hot drinks category and is also projected to be the fastest growing over 2011-2016. Although coffee is more than double the size of other hot drinks, the next largest category due to the popularity of mate primarily in mountainous regions, it is also expected to grow at a faster rate, posting 29% retail value growth over 2011-2016 compared to 21% for other hot drinks. Brazil will account for the majority of this growth (almost two out of every three US dollars).</p>
<p>Showing the versatility of different coffee formats, growth in Brazil is being driven by standard fresh ground coffee. A strong coffee culture and rising incomes are supporting the growth of standard fresh ground coffee. While Nestlé recently introduced the Dolce Gusto pod system as a low-priced alternative to Nespresso, the cost of the coffee machine is still proving to be something of a problem for the Brazilian consumer.</p>
<h2>Successful innovations mean a bright future</h2>
<p>Coffee's different formats offer consumers a range of benefits, and it is these benefits, ranging from the convenient preparation of instant coffee to the premium pod format, which are supporting coffee growth. Coffee is penetrating traditional tea markets and is also able to grow in mature markets because of these value-added consumer benefits. Despite large mature markets, the future profitability of coffee is likely to increase almost as quickly as in the past. </p>

South Korea’s Booming Coffee Shops Category Becoming a Key Channel for Premium Soft Drinks,"Having reached a remarkable level of density and coverage in a relatively short time, South Korea's booming specialist coffee shop category has become a key retail channel for premium soft drinks manufacturers. ","<p>Having reached a remarkable level of density and coverage in a relatively short time, South Korea's booming specialist coffee shop category has become a key retail channel for premium soft drinks manufacturers. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>With coffee shops now a fixture in most major cities—and seemingly on every street corner in Seoul—a growing symbiosis continues to emerge between soft drinks manufacturers seeking to leverage the strong traffic and attractive demographics of coffee shops to drive new product awareness and coffee shop owners looking to reinforce their branding with a strong portfolio of interesting, high-quality bottled beverages. With similar growth stories playing out in multiple global markets, specialist coffee shops (and foodservice outlets in general) are expected to take on growing importance as a launching pad for new products, as operators' thirst for high-end beverage options continues to intensify. </p>
<h2>Scorching growth draws attention from drinks players</h2>
<p>Coffee consumption is nothing new in South Korea—instant coffee has long been highly popular, and remains the preferred choice for home coffee consumption, while traditional cafes, or dabang, gained prominence in the 1960's and 70's as a place to sip (usually instant) coffee and listen to popular music, not unlike Japan's kissaten. What's more, vending machines remain a popular means of coffee consumption, and are found throughout major cities. In the last 3-4 years, however, modern specialist coffee shops have exploded in popularity, with sales surpassing US$1.4 billion (1.5 trillion won) in 2011. As it has in other countries, Starbucks has served as a key catalyst of this trend, introducing many Koreans, particularly young people, to the virtues of high-quality drip coffee and espresso drinks. The American chain remains the leading specialist coffee shop chain in South Korea, with estimated 2010 sales of US$230 million (250 billion won), while average annual sales growth has remained in the double-digits since the chain's arrival. </p>
<p>This kind of growth has not gone unnoticed among drinks manufacturers, particularly small “boutique” players looking to maximise exposure for premium brands. One example of this is I'm Real, by Pulmuone Co Ltd, the first not from concentrate 100% juice in South Korea, which was introduced in 2009 with initial distribution confined solely to chained specialist coffee shops such as Starbucks, Coffee Bean, Tom N Toms and in department stores. Limited distribution helped to reinforce an image of exclusivity and quality for the relatively high-priced brand, which sells for US$2.60 per 190ml bottle. Despite the high unit price, the limited distribution strategy has proven quite successful, setting up a wider push into South Korea's massive convenience store channel in 2010. Similar stories can be seen in categories such as carbonated bottled water, where major brands such as Nestlé Korea's Perrier are widely available through coffee shops, which enjoy significant traffic from Perrier's core demographic of young female consumers in their 20s and 30s. Carbonated bottled water has emerged as a high-value niche category in South Korea, with total value sales nearly tripling (albeit from a very small base) to approach US$9 million in 2011. This is of a piece with a broader process of premiumisation in bottled water, with high-end still brands such as Evian, Chojung, and the newly-introduced Fiji brand all enjoying strong growth in the last 2-3 years. </p>
<h3>A perfect match</h3>
<p>While prominent placement in high-traffic, high-prestige coffee shop locations is an obvious positive for soft drinks manufacturers looking to establish new products, a strong beverage portfolio carries real benefits for operators, as well. The category's meteoric growth in South Korea—total outlets now stand at just over 7,000, up from 4,000 in 2006—has created a brutal competitive environment, particularly for smaller players lacking the branding power of a Starbucks or a local chain like Angel-in-us. Finding a way to stand out in a field which grows more crowded by the day is essential, and a differentiated beverage portfolio can form a vital component of this strategy. This is particularly true given current trends among South Korean consumers—premium products and premium branding continue to receive an enthusiastic reception, particularly among urban young people with high disposable incomes, likely fuelling a continued push for unique, upscale products and cutting-edge outlet designs in a specialist coffee shop category which is ripe for further segmentation. Chilled, not-from-concentrate juices, premium carbonates, bottled water sourced from 10,000 metre-deep ocean water—these products have all carved out a market in South Korea, and a carefully curated collection can prove highly effective in further reinforcing any coffee shop's chosen brand identity. </p>
<p>The relatively unique structure of the category in South Korea could also play a role in driving this trend—several of South Korea's largest foodservice and retail players operate coffee shop chains, with Starbucks outlets operated as part of a joint venture with department store chain Shinsegae, while local chain Angel-in-us is a subsidiary or retail/foodservice giant Lotte Group. For companies with an interest in both the retail and foodservice sides of the equation, the ability to roll out new products through specialist coffee shops and other select on-trade channels could prove highly effective in building scale and interest for a profitable rollout through supermarkets and other retail channels, in much the same way Starbucks has used its vast network of outlets in the US to drive the adoption of its own branded retail products there. </p>
<h4>A global trend set to intensify</h4>
<p>While foodservice outlets have long been an important component of branding and sales for the largest global drinks players, recent trends have combined to create a wide array of new opportunities, particularly in developed markets. Large-scale initiatives to upgrade and enhance the in-store experience from the likes of McDonald's, Starbucks, and YUM! Brands have created a large number of highly inviting spaces, with contemporary designs and comfortable furnishings helping to create an effective halo for new bottled beverage products, one which soft drinks players have only just begun to tap into. </p>
<p>What's more, demand for new beverage products among the largest foodservice players is growing by the day, part of an ongoing quest for differentiation and relevance across multiple eating occasions. This combination of demand for new products and the emergence of highly attractive “showpiece” foodservice outlets is likely to fuel a host of potential innovations, among the introduction of special limited-time only products for particular chains and locations, not unlike the use of duty-free shops as specialised channels for rolling out high-end and/or limited edition spirits products. As foodservice operators continue to invest in creating in-store experiences as unique and carefully-planned as any retailer, the potential for effective new product push through this channel will only grow. </p>

US Pod Coffee Market Poised For Further Expansion,"As US coffee pods transition from niche product to mainstay, category leaders in Western Europe provide insights for future growth.","<p>As US coffee pods transition from niche product to mainstay, category leaders in Western Europe provide insights for future growth.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The US fresh ground coffee pod industry is dominated by one name: Green Mountain. But, despite reporting impressive results in early May, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) stock tumbled as this figure was well below the 50% growth the company had sought. Many analysts commented on GMCR's inability to forecast its market, while noting the uncertainty the company faces in light of its coming patent expirations. But whether or not GMCR will lose share once their monopoly on the K Cup model expires, coffee pods as a market are here to stay. By examining how the US pod market has merely scratched the surface with its exponential growth, and how pods fared similarly in Western Europe, specifically France, it is clear that pods are changing the way more and more Americans consume their coffee.</p>
<h2>US single serve coffee market on the rise</h2>
<p>Fresh ground coffee pods have exploded in the US over the past five years, growing retail volume by 523% from 2006 to 2011. Once niche products, pod machines have become increasingly popular in workplaces and households, with pods now available in mainstream grocery stores and hypermarkets, led by products from foodservice brands like Dunkin' Donuts. While pod penetration is still relatively low compared with other types of coffee in the US, single-serve coffee pod machines now account for 20% of total coffee machine volume sales, up from 4% in 2006. Total coffee machine sales are projected to increase by 20% from 2011 to 2016, largely driven by pod machine expansion. Consequently, fresh ground coffee pods are expected to lead growth within coffee from 2011 to 2016 with off-trade volume growth of 74%. </p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Top 5 Coffee Pod Markets</h4>
<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\515f2209-0b6e-4fc3-8069-3e9235f3876a.jpg""></p>
<p>In many ways, the rapid expansion in pods now underway in the US mirrors that seen in Western Europe years before, where pods now hold significant share. While fresh ground coffee pods represented a mere 2% of all US off trade fresh coffee retail volume in 2011, they held a 23% share in France, which saw a large spike in coffee pod volume in 2005, with 26% growth, followed by 35% growth in 2006, thanks to pod and pod brewer manufacturers Kraft Foods (Tassimo) and Sara Lee (Senseo) spending almost US$10 million each on advertisements promoting their machines' ability to provide customers with a convenient product of professional quality. With consumers increasingly leading on-the-go lifestyles, pods quickly became a hit as the machines allowed them to brew single serve cups of coffee similar to beverages they purchased in local cafés. </p>
<p>Many believed that the global economic downturn would present difficulties for pods as they were both priced and positioned as a premium product. However, share actually grew as premium brewers such as Nestlé SA's Nespresso line targeted high income households. Combined with the more affordable Senseo machines, which had already penetrated medium/low income homes, coffee pods underwent a segmentation that further engrained them into coffee culture. This premiumisation resulted in the more expensive coffee pods surpassing standard fresh ground and fresh coffee beans in retail sales, accounting for more than 50% of retail sales value. It became clear that consumers in France will pay more for the quality and convenience of pod coffee. </p>
<h2>Brewers prepare for market growth and price segmentation</h2>
<p>Like the French, Americans are regularly on the go, and, given the success of foodservice specialty coffee shops, consumers have developed an appreciation for high end fresh brewed coffee. But to assume that the US pod market will mirror France ignores significant differences between the two. On a per capita basis, Americans consumed 276.4 off trade cups of coffee in 2011 compared to 395.1 in France. Coffee in France is often consumed in the smaller and stronger espressos or cappuccinos rather than the larger “cup of joe” preferred by most Americans. The average French cup of coffee is 150 mL, brewed with 45 g of coffee per litre compared to 300 mL and 32 g per litre in the US, respectively. The French also consume coffee drinks multiple times in the day, as part of social gatherings whether it be on-trade or at home, while the US market remains heavily skewed towards morning consumption. Because of these fundamental differences in consumption, it is unrealistic to think that the US market can reach the levels of France; however, as manufacturers continue to provide consumers with customisation and price segmentation, pods will continue to take share from other coffee types.</p>
<p>The Keurig has found success in the US while the higher priced Nespresso has struggled, owing to Keurig's speed and ease of use in producing a high quality cup of coffee more appealing for American consumption, rather than the “European” coffees that Nespresso recreates. Combine this with the licensing agreements between Keurig and many popular specialty coffee brands like Caribou, Starbucks, and Dunkin' Donuts, and US consumers can use the machines to recreate the on-trade experience and thereby give a perception of quality at lower price points. Furthermore, once GMCR's K cup patents expire in September 2012, more coffee roasters will make pods for Keurig machines, thereby driving prices further down and making the product more accessible to consumers. </p>
<p>As more consumers become exposed to the pod format, manufacturers are also becoming more cognizant of the importance of customisation. Companies such as Nespresso, Starbucks, and GMCR are banking on economic recovery as an indicator that the US will mimic France's pod brewer segmentation. Nestlé hoping increase in spending will increase the sales of the Nespresso amongst higher income consumers seeking espressos and cappuccinos. GMCR launched its next generation pod brewer, the Vue in March 2012, touting its ability to customize drinks and produce café beverages such as lattes. And Starbucks has announced a holiday release of its Verismo single cup brewer, which the company claims will be able to produce the perfect latté due to new technologies with milk pods. </p>
<p>With household penetration rising and players such as Starbucks entering the premium brewer market, exposure for single cup machines will only increase, thereby pushing the market further. These new pod varieties and brewers will go a long way toward providing the customisation and differentiation that succeeded in France. So, while it may be overly optimistic to assume the US will follow Western Europe in terms of penetration, pod share, and consumption, it is realistic to envision a market where pod present a real threat for other coffee types.</p>

Forecasts Show New Value for the Taking in Latin America Specialist Coffee Shops,"After seeing the fastest growth over the review period, Latin America is set to record even greater specialist coffee shop value increases, making it a prime target for local and multinational chains.","<p>After seeing the fastest growth over the review period, Latin America is set to record even greater specialist coffee shop value increases, making it a prime target for local and multinational chains.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Though Latin America is still one of the smaller specialist coffee shop regions, key markets are seeing growing café culture as urban consumers seek out low-priced ways to participate in premium foodservice. The region saw US$960 million in new value over the review period and 2011-2016 growth is expected to add another US$1.1 billion. Furthermore, despite contributing just 6% of global specialist coffee shop value, Latin America will contribute 13% of the total value increase by 2016, a fact which has not gone unnoticed by chains. Starbucks recently announced an aggressive expansion strategy for Latin America, including plans for several hundred Brazilian outlets and 300 additional units across Mexico and Argentina, all within the next five years. </p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Specialist Coffee Shop Value in Key Latin America Markets</h4>
<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\4d1bc8bc-188e-4798-b5a3-8a61838b8e2a.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor International</p>
<h2>Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia to contribute 95% of the forecasted value increase</h2>
<p>Mexico's specialist coffee shop segment has more than doubled since 2006, and the majority of this has been attributable to chains. While Starbucks claims a 37% share, many local players are rapidly gaining ground, including second-ranked Café Punta del Cielo, which has grown from just 4% of the market to 17% in five years. The chain, which pairs gourmet positioning with a mission statement that emphasises the goal of elevating Mexican coffee to compete in quality on a global stage, capitalizes on a hyper-modern décor and premium ambiance to lure relatively affluent urban customers.</p>
<p>Colombia is expected to contribute another US$212 million in new value, effectively doubling in size. Notably, however, Starbucks does not have a share in the market despite sourcing heavily from its local farmers. Instead, McCafé, and local chains Juan Valdez and Oma claim the top spots, with the majority share belonging to independents. The challenge in Colombia lies in the fact that the majority of coffee-drinking is usually done in the home, and as such, local players have been forced to give consumers a reason to venture out for a product they can easily make themselves. The most successful chains have done so by adopting a premium positioning, promoting beverages that can't easily be replicated in the home, such as blended coffee drinks, and providing a comfortable atmosphere for socializing. With sufficient differentiation, these chains will have a chance to claim additional share from independents as the category evolves.</p>
<p>Brazil is the second major target in Starbucks' expansion strategy, with “several hundred” new outlets planned by 2015. The market represents a major growth opportunity, but Starbucks is currently ranked fourth with only 35 local outlets. While the company has not released an exact growth target, an addition of at least 250 outlets would place the chain even in size with the largest local chain in the market. But the real question is, will ubiquity alone be enough to draw Brazilian consumers?</p>
<h3>An opportunity for growth, or a strategy destined to fail?</h3>
<p>At first glance, Starbucks' plan seems ill-advised: Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, and the market has a well-developed coffee culture centred around independent padarias. These café and bakery hybrids serve fresh-baked bread, pastries and coffee to consumers who sometimes visit as much as once or twice per day. Dining-in is common, and customers often socialize over coffee while enjoying their purchases. So what makes Starbucks think it can sell Brazilian coffee back to Brazilians better than all the cafes currently in the market?  According to the operator, the keys will be quality, experience and menu variation. </p>
<p>Starbucks and its chained competitors have so far been able to take share by adopting a premium positioning in terms of coffee quality and flavour. While premium coffee is certainly available in the market, especially in the European-influenced Sao Paolo, the majority of coffee served by cafes competes mainly on convenience and price. Instant coffee is popular, and until recently much of the coffee grown locally was low-grade rather than high-end Arabica beans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Starbucks and its competitors also offer an atmospheric component, giving young urban consumers a place to relax for a few hours with a book, some friends or a laptop. This kind of “third place” environment was not previously common in Brazil, but the idea jives effectively with local preferences for dining-in. </p>
<p>Finally, specialist coffee shops also offer a diverse range of beverages that go beyond typical café offerings. Third-ranked Café do Ponto, for example, serves a Café Soberano (coffee with brandy, cocoa liqueur, condensed milk and Chantilly), Café Harmonia (coffee with steamed milk and chocolate) and Coffee Shake (coffee blended with ice), all of which appeal to young consumers looking for more exciting foodservice experiences. Starbucks has capitalised on a similar strategy with its wide-range of beverages, and according to the company, its target demographic in Brazil skews younger than in other markets. The brand markets itself as trendy, modern and aspirational, a combination that appeals particularly well to young consumers with rising disposable incomes.</p>
<h4>Success is within reach</h4>
<p>While each of the major Latin America markets offers a unique set of challenges, they also share one key factor: all have well-developed coffee drinking cultures and middle- to high-income consumers interested in premium foodservice. Thus, the secret to Starbucks' success in the region will lie not in its ability to convince consumers to drink coffee, but rather in its ability to change the way they think about their daily coffee habit. </p>
<p>Likewise, specialist coffee shops can stand out by positioning themselves as youthful and innovative, offering a wide variety of exciting beverage options. In terms of dining experience, these players need to offer more than just a place to sit, but rather a comfortable atmosphere and the opportunity to socialize, read a book, or surf the internet in a premium environment. With these goals in mind, specialist coffee shops will have the ability to claim significant share in Latin America over the forecast period, even moving beyond the specialist coffee shop niche to take share from cafes. And Starbucks, with a 2011 value share of 20% and plans to open 500 more outlets over the forecast period, stands to reap considerable benefits as this new coffee-drinking culture evolves.</p>

Russian Coffee Market Heats Up As Consumer Demand Shifts,"While still a nation of tea drinkers in many respects, coffee consumption in Russia continues to soar, with a core group of aficionados continuing to drive consumer tastes forward, towards fresher, bolder roasts and away from long-dominant instant brands. ","<p>While still a nation of tea drinkers in many respects, coffee consumption in Russia continues to soar, with a core group of aficionados continuing to drive consumer tastes forward, towards fresher, bolder roasts and away from long-dominant instant brands. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Demand from Moscow and St Petersburg continues to drive consumption growth, with the two cities accounting for fully-one-third of coffee sales volume in Russia in 2011. While global instant coffee brands continue to build consumer loyalty, growing on-trade consumption of coffee, often through one of hundreds of urban cafes, has helped drive awareness of fresh coffee, a category which remains dominated by local players, yet which is poised to become an increasingly important component of demand over the next five years.</p>
<h2>City-dwellers drive consumption, key trends</h2>
<p>Though Russia still boasts one of the highest rates of tea consumption in the world, at around 190 litres (in RTD volume terms) annually, it is already the ninth largest coffee market in volume terms, at around 120,000 tonnes in 2011. Two-thirds of this is instant, with Russia's instant coffee market second only to Thailand's in terms of volumes consumed. In major cities, coffee consumption is already well established—according to statistics from Paulig, a Finnish producer with a strong Russian presence, fully 80% of Moscow residents already drink coffee, with around 50% of adult residents consuming it on a daily basis. Global brands such as Nestle's Nescafe and Kraft's Jacobs dominate, with those two companies alone accounting for around 60% of total instant coffee volume sales. </p>
<p>Yet while instant coffee continues to grow, and major brands continue to take share—a sign of continued demand for high-quality, branded products, even outside of major urban areas—the pace of growth lags well behind fresh coffee, which continues to win converts, particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The on-trade coffee scene in both cities continues to expand by leaps and bounds, exposing an ever-larger swathe of consumers to high-end coffee preparation. According to Euromonitor International estimates, the specialist coffee shop category surpassed US$600 million in 2011, more than double sales from just five years before, with local chains Shokoladnitsa and Coffee House well in front with a combined 50% share. </p>
<h3>Fresh coffee takes centre stage</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, off-trade sales of fresh coffee have followed suit, with volumes averaging 8% annual expansion from 2006 to 2011, approaching 35,000 tonnes in 2011, again according to Euromonitor International estimates.  Value sales growth has been faster still, averaging 20% annual expansion during the same period, taking the category past US$800 million in sales in 2011. Much of this expansion has favoured local operators such as Orimi, owner of the low-priced Jockey brand, which accounted for 25% of off-trade value sales in 2011. In second place is Finland's Paulig and its higher-priced eponymous brand. International operators remain well off the pace, reflecting both high import tariffs and a strong focus on instant coffee until quite recently. </p>
<p>Orimi has also proven quite adept at responding to local preferences—its brands tend to use a milder, lighter roast, with the company's advertisements contrasting the taste of Jockey coffee against the “bitterness” of French roasts or the “acidity” of Scandinavian blend. The company has likewise made heavy use of its sampling program, handing out single-serve sachets of fresh coffee to consumers across Russia, a campaign which proved so successful it led to the launch of the Jockey Oriental brand, using similar single-serve portions. Containing finely-ground coffee which is combined with boiling water in the cup, the line also reflects a historic preference for Turkish-style coffee in many Russian households, with filter-style coffee still a relative rarity. </p>
<h3>A maturing market, poised for further change </h3>
<p>Over the next five years, growth in overall coffee consumption will remain steady, yet fresh coffee will continue to take share—by 2016, fresh coffee will account for 23% of total coffee consumption, up from 19% today, with value sales expected to surpass US$1.3 billion. This should continue to attract the attention of global operators, many of whom have barely scratched the surface of the fresh coffee market. Among others, they will be following the lead of Paulig, which opened a US$30 million roasting facility in the Tver region in 2011. The new plant has an initial capacity of 6,000 tonnes annually, almost twice the company's current sales volumes, while also conveniently located midway between Moscow and St. Petersburg. Not to be outdone, both Kraft and Nestle announced plans to expand capacity in their Russian soluble-coffee facilities, reflecting continued strong forecasts for the instant coffee market.  </p>
<p>Growing awareness of good coffee should drive further demand for better-quality, value-added products for home use. While the biggest and best-known coffee shop brands, Shokoladnitsa and Coffee House, both put a heavy emphasis on food and ambience, a growing number of high-end, “third-wave” coffee shops can be found in Moscow and St Petersburg, reflecting a core urban consumer base which continues to grow more sophisticated. While overall volume growth can be expected to slow, this process, coupled with steady income growth in major cities should keep value sales expanding briskly for years to come. </p>",1535,1,395,2012-07-31 20:32:55,210731,39,2012-07-31 00:00:00,IWArticle
Retail Coffee Sales Stay Buoyant as Greek Consumers Retain Desire for Small Luxuries,"While the Greek economy remains mired in a deep recession, with no end in sight, off-trade coffee sales have continued to expand, with consumers trading frequent visits to the café for a relaxing cup at home. ","<p>While the Greek economy remains mired in a deep recession, with no end in sight, off-trade coffee sales have continued to expand, with consumers trading frequent visits to the café for a relaxing cup at home. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Although cafés were among the last foodservice categories to be affected, given coffee's low prices relative to alcoholic drinks, collapsing living standards have finally led many Greek consumers cut back on visits to the cafe. The smoking ban has also played a role, leading a substantial portion of the population to take their afternoon coffee at home. The end has been a surprising resilience for retail coffee sales, particularly more premium brands, suggesting a strong desire for small indulgences even among the most value-conscious consumers.  </p>
<h2>Consumers seek comfort, stability—and a decent cup of coffee</h2>
<p>Four years of stagnant-to-declining GDP have had a devastating impact on Greece's massive café category, with 2011 sales just two-thirds those seen in 2008. As more Greeks choose to stay at home, both alone and with friends, new consumption patterns are emerging. Despite the recession, declining disposable incomes and a consequent drop in foodservice expenditure, hot drinks have been hit less hard than other industries, where sales have recorded double-digit declines. Whilst on-trade sales declined significantly in all hot drinks categories in 2010 and 2011, the “cocooning” trend, of consumers turning inward and staying home in a time of turmoil, helped to limit the decline in off-trade sales. Indeed, both value and volume sales of coffee saw positive growth through off-trade channels in 2011, with a pullback in café spending partially replaced by new occasions for home consumption. </p>

<p>Given lower unit prices through retail, Greek consumers have found room to spend on a higher-quality home coffee-drinking experience, in terms of both products and preparation. Sales of home coffee machines are increasing, with a growing number of consumers looking to have a high-quality coffee at home rather than instant coffee. This is reflected in the rise in sales of coffee pods—despite the high cost of pod machines, coffee pods was the best performing category in 2011, suggesting a strong desire by Greek consumers to treat themselves. Similarly, while instant coffee sales have declined in both value and volume terms for the last three years running, off-trade fresh coffee sales have surged, up nine and three percent in value and volume terms, respectively, in 2011, continuing a strong growth trend between 2006 and 2011. </p>

<h3>The changing face of value</h3>
<p>The cocooning trend is expected to continue to develop over the foreseeable future, especially among younger people. Shrinking disposable incomes will force consumers to further reduce their spending in on-trade establishments. Newly unemployed consumers constitute a target group that has been forced to reduce expenditure on socialising and dining outside the home and that will increasingly focus on home entertainment. With unemployment expected to rise considerably over the coming years and disposable incomes forecast to shrink even further, entertainment habits will become more and more oriented towards staying in. In addition, the fact that the smoking ban will have to eventually be fully enforced in line with EU regulations will further contribute to Greeks replacing visits to a café with gatherings at home.</p>
<p>At the same time, it speaks to the enduring importance of luxury, of indulgence, of socialising, even amidst a truly grim economic outlook. While consumers in Greece and elsewhere have obviously been forced to economise as a result of difficult economic conditions, this process has not been a matter of cutting back across the board; instead, it is a matter of picking and choosing one's indulgences, spending less on one product, or through one channel, in order to spend more elsewhere, while still spending less overall. While the discussion of which consumer packaged goods producers have benefited most (or perhaps suffered the least) as a result of the recession has often centred on very low-priced value and private label brands, there is also great opportunity in taking on “foodservice staples,” those everyday/multiple times a week “ritual” purchases such as morning or afternoon coffee where a real pricing umbrella exists. As consumers cut back on such a regular, beloved part of daily life, they are not looking to stop altogether—Greek consumers are not about to stop drinking coffee, recession or no recession—nor are they looking for the cheapest possible alternative. Instead, what works is often a premium packaged product, albeit one considerably cheaper than on-trade coffee, which allows consumers a chance to recreate not just the flavour, or the caffeine jolt, but in some small way the experience they have left behind. </p>

"Australian Café Chain Coffee Club Thrives With a Flexible, Food-Driven Strategy","Now Australia's fourth-largest homegrown chain, Coffee Club serves as a powerful example of the ways innovative restaurant operators have made strict category distinctions increasingly irrelevant. ","<p>Now Australia's fourth-largest homegrown chain, Coffee Club serves as a powerful example of the ways innovative restaurant operators have made strict category distinctions increasingly irrelevant. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>As the name suggests, coffee is a focus at Coffee Club, with a wide array of coffee drinks designed to appeal to discerning Australian coffee drinkers. Yet the food menu is vast and regularly updated, while many outlets feature full table service and dwarf standard coffee shops in terms of size. What the chain has done quite successfully is to carve out its own distinct niche—“coffee-driven casual dining,” perhaps—one which allows considerable flexibility in terms of outlet formats and occasions served. In a world where café culture varies strongly from market to market, and where many casual dining chains appear bereft of direction or identity, Coffee Club offers a potential path forward. </p>
<h2>Origins drive multifaceted approach</h2>
<p>The Coffee Club was launched in 1989 with a single outlet in Brisbane, on the east coast of Australia, in the state of Queensland. It would remain entirely Brisbane-based until the 1993 opening of an outlet on the city of Gold Coast. Indeed, for much of its history Coffee Club has been a Queensland-only operation, a fact which has shaped the evolution of the brand. Lacking the well-developed café culture of Sydney or Melbourne, Brisbane (and, more broadly, the state of Queensland) supported the development of a broader offer, combining elements of both casual dining and specialist coffee shops, driving both full-meal occasions and quick meetings over coffee at a time when eating out options in the region were still comparatively limited. </p>
<p>In contrast to many cafes and casual dining operators currently struggling to branch out, Coffee Club has always been a hybrid, combining a full selection of speciality coffee drinks with a full menu and wine selection. Over time, it has adopted several outlet formats designed to serve different locations and occasions—the first is the classic “Café Bar Restaurant” is a full-service format with full table service, longer opening hours, and menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; the second is the “Club” format, combining counter service with a range of light meals, gourmet sandwiches (made on site), coffees, drinks and cakes; while the third is a kiosk format designed for malls and other areas where space is at a premium. The multifaceted approach allows the chain to credibly combine elements of fast casual, casual dining, and specialist coffee shops under a single brand, allowing it to remain relevant across all the occasions these formats serve. </p>
<p>At the same time, the chain has steadily upgraded its offerings--as consumers in Australia and New Zealand have become more “gourmet” in their eating habits, so has The Coffee Club focused more on full-service restaurant meal offerings. It features an ever-changing selection of menu offerings, which The Coffee Club has branded Chef's Choices. Similarly, 2011 saw the launch of The Coffee Club's National Promotions Food Tour, which showcases cuisines from selected countries around the world. The first campaign, Taste of Thailand, went on to win the Marketing Excellence Award at the 2011 Westpac FCA Excellence in Franchising Awards. Taste of Thailand was followed by the Best of Greece in August/September 2011.</p>
<h3>The way forward</h3>
<p>Coffee Club's strategy has proven highly effective thus far, with the chain surpassing US$210 million in 2011 sales in Australia alone, while averaging better than ten percent annual sales growth since 2006. The chain has also attracted international attention, with Thai franchise operator Minor International purchasing a 50% stake in 2009, while outlets are now open in Egypt, Thailand, New Caledonia, and China. Indeed, Coffee Club's approach to the café, with its emphasis on food, drink, and full table service, could prove highly attractive in markets outside Australia, particularly in the Middle East, where coffee shops remain a primary social outlet. Rather than a “grab and go” stopping point early in the morning, coffee shops in the region are a place to meet with friends, often well into the night, with a premium, full-service presentation highly appreciated. As specialist coffee shops look to serve a wider range of occasions, a move towards this type of food-driven, service-oriented approach is probable. </p>
<p>For casual dining chains, Coffee Club offers an even more powerful lesson, demonstrating the power of a true focus on beverages. Never a mere add-on, coffee (and to a lesser degree beer, wine, and soft drinks) has always formed a basic part of the chain's identity, always fully integrated into service models, distribution networks, and outlet design. Going forward, it is precisely this kind of approach which is likely to prove most successful, whether from a chain offering a vast beer selection, a focus on handcrafted cocktails, or even house-made sodas—while beverages can be a powerful tool, a “bolt-on” approach is always likely to disappoint. At the same time, a successful focus opens up a world of opportunities for outlet innovation, as it radically expands the range of occasions served, which in turn drives a host of opportunities to further segment a given market. </p>

Specialist Coffee Shops Help Drive Surge in Mexico Coffee Consumption,"The emergence of a strong national coffee culture continues apace in Mexico, with consumption nearly doubling over the last ten years.","<p>The emergence of a strong national coffee culture continues apace in Mexico, with consumption nearly doubling over the last ten years.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>As in other markets, much of the surge in consumption seen in Mexico has been fuelled by growing demand for fresh coffee, spurred by the rising popularity of specialist coffee shop chains such as Starbucks. That said, this is not an imported trend—many of Mexico's most popular coffee shops, as well as practically all of it major retail coffee brands, are local in origin, highlighting the country's long status as a major coffee grower. While historically much of this was exported, this is changing rapidly, reflecting a common trend among major coffee growing markets as disposable incomes continue to rise. Going forward, Mexico's status as a major growth market is expected to persist, while also potentially serving as a launch-pad for coffee house players with regional or even global ambitions. </p>
<h2>The Starbucks effect</h2>
<p>According to figures of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO), coffee consumption in Mexico increased by over 80% between 2000 and 2010, rising from 1.3 million 60kg sacks of green coffee in 2000 to 2.35 million sacks by 2010. Over the same period of time, the size of Mexico's population aged over 18 years—the target audience for coffee as minors are not regular coffee drinkers in Mexico—increased by only 22.5%, indicating higher per capita consumption among this age group and the development of a much stronger coffee culture in Mexico. It remains important to note that current domestic per capita consumption of green coffee in Mexico—estimated at 1.2kg per capita per annum—remains considerably lower than that of other coffee growing countries such as Costa Rica and Brazil, suggesting that there is still considerable room for further growth in coffee consumption in Mexico.</p>
<p>Much of the impetus for this trend comes from the specialist coffee shops outlets which continue to appear across Mexico, with multinational player Starbucks leading this trend. Indeed, it could be argued that the turning point for specialist coffee shops in Mexico came in 2002 with the arrival of Starbucks in the country. The company quickly revolutionised specialist coffee shops in Mexico, inspiring a number of imitators which have also expanded across Mexico. The estimated number of specialist coffee shop outlets tripled between 2002 and 2011, rising from 480 to 1,500, while value sales in the consumer foodservice channel increased five-fold, rising from Mx$1 billion to Mx$5.6 billion between 2002 and 2011.</p>
<p>The ongoing proliferation of specialist coffee shops in Mexico which began 2002 has resulted in much faster growth of sales of coffee through on-trade trade channels than through off-trade channels. Coffee increased in on-trade volume by 6% in 2011, 50% higher than the growth recorded in off-trade volume sales. Given the high growth in the number of specialist coffee shops, it was surprising that on-trade volume growth was not higher in coffee during 2011. In order to illustrate the extent of the massive expansion in the number of specialist coffee shops in Mexico, in 2000 it was estimated there were fewer than 400 specialist coffee shops in Mexico, a figure which had climbed to 1,500 by the end of 2011. Over the same period, on-trade volume sales of coffee in Mexico had increased five-fold. Interestingly, Mexico's many of medium-sized coffee growers are developing their own specialist coffee shop chains and are making attempts to become strong players in chained specialist coffee shops.</p>
<h3>Strong local coffee culture emerging</h3>
<p>Currently, per capita consumption of green coffee in Mexico is estimated to be 12 times lower than the consumption of green coffee in the European countries which are the global leaders in coffee consumption. This suggests that there is considerable room for growth in coffee in Mexico. Furthermore, other coffee producing nations with similar levels of economic development, such as Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica have per capita domestic coffee consumption double or triple Mexico's coffee consumption. In addition, there seems to be no end in sight for the ongoing increase in the consumption of coffee in Mexico, not least because specialist coffee shops continue to flourish across the country as Mexicans become better educated about coffee culture. </p>
<p>Indeed, the rapid expansion of the category has spurred a distinct process of segmentation as consumers grow more sophisticated—Starbucks remained the leading chain in cafés/bars with an overall value share of 4% and chained value share of 38% in 2011. Starbucks benefits from a number of factors, being the brand that sets the standard for specialist coffee shops in Mexico and serving as a model for other operators in this channel. Despite having been present in Mexico for only 10 years, the brand has a well-established lead in specialist coffee shops, benefiting from heavy investments from parent company Alsea. In a distant second, XKMEX's Café Punta del Cielo accounted for close to 2% of total value sales and 17% of chained value in 2011. Café Punta del Cielo is successful at communicating a sophisticated image while basing its range on traditional Mexican products and ingredients. The Italian Coffee Company, meanwhile, is the leading player in terms of outlet volume, with over 400 units. However, its low sales per outlet results in this brand ranking third in value terms, with its average transaction price being considerably lower than that of Starbucks or Café Punta del Cielo.  Finally, there are traditional cafes, found almost exclusively in coffee growing states in south such as Veracruz, Chiapas, Puebla and Oaxaca. Most cafés are based in small and mid-sized cities and tend to be independent and family-owned and –operated businesses. </p>
<p>Coffee consumption in Mexico is projected to continue its ascent between 2011 and 2015. All of the conditions which stimulated the rapid rise in coffee consumption in Mexico during the review period such as the rapid expansion of specialist coffee shops, the rising numbers of young people immersing themselves in coffee culture and the ongoing domestic production of a vast amounts of coffee are all likely to remain major influences over coffee in Mexico during the forecast period, with constant price increases one of the few constraints on booming demand for coffee. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the inelastic nature of demand for coffee and the likelihood of ongoing export surpluses mean that the outlook for coffee in Mexico remains even more promising, although coffee exports are likely to continue diminishing as domestic coffee consumption continues to increase rapidly and growth in coffee production remains either static or marginal. Exports accounted for 73% of Mexico's total coffee production in 2000, but only 46.5% during 2010. Over the next five years, this shift from coffee exporter to coffee consumer is expected to continue, alongside similar markets like Brazil and Vietnam, portending further shifts in the global coffee supply chain. </p>

Starbucks-Square Partnership Could Enhance the Coffeehouse Experience,"Starbucks Corp., announced a recent partnership with payments start-up, Square Inc., that could not only be a major coup for Square, but potentially transformative for the coffee giant. ","<p>Starbucks Corp., announced a recent partnership with payments start-up, Square Inc., that could not only be a major coup for Square, but potentially transformative for the coffee giant. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Square is a fast-rising start-up in the payments world that was the first to introduce the “dongle” concept in 2010 to enable mobile phones to work like credit card machines via the help of a small device that is inserted into the headphone jack. Although the dongles won't be used in Starbucks locations as part of this agreement, Square will begin processing all credit and debit card transactions in Starbucks' 7,000 US stores in October. Square's processing system will be integrated into Starbucks' existing POS hardware so this particular setup will not alter how the consumer pays. For Starbucks' customers wanting to pay via their mobile phone, they would open a mobile app and show the barista 2D bar code on their phones. In time customers will be able to use Square's latest product called Pay with Square to order their tall Caffe Americano just by saying their name. Starbucks also invested $25 million in Square as part of its latest round of financing and Starbucks top executive Howard Schultz will join Square's board. </p>
<h2>Partnership is a win-win for both companies</h2>
<p>This alliance is a natural fit for both companies. For Square, the partnership significantly expands its presence and puts it in every US neighbourhood. It also is the best validation for Square's product outside of Visa's investment a year ago and dealt a blow to NFC-driven products like Google Wallet and Isis, which has garnered much of the attention in the US. The partnership also comes at a time that Square faces increasing pressure from rivals like eBay Inc., Intuit Inc. and VeriFone Systems Inc., which also have similar mobile POS products. Most importantly it's big for Square's bottom line. Square processed US$6 billion in credit card purchases in 2011. In comparison, Starbucks had $8 billion in sales across its US outlets. The only potential pitfalls to this agreement is whether Square is ready for the big stage, which involves processing the type of volume a major retailer like Starbucks does on a daily basis and also doing so without fraudulent activity anywhere in the system. </p>
<p>It's not surprising that Starbucks teamed up with the mobile payments start-up. The coffeehouse giant has become the mobile payments poster child since it currently operates the most wildly used mobile payments app and Starbucks' regulars have shown a thirst for mobile payment. Since its launch in January 2011, Starbucks has processed 60 million mobile transactions or currently one million mobile payments per week. Customers will be able to use the existing app, which links to a virtual gift card, but the reality is that Starbucks didn't have a great mobile solution for customers wanting to pay with their credit or debit card. Schultz said the deal will cut processing fees as well. Square traditionally charges 2.75% per card swipe, but likely will lower the rate for Starbucks due to scale.</p>
<h2>New system takes ordering the “usual” to a new level</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps most important, however, is that the Starbucks brand experience could be transformed by a second product that will be introduced after the initial rollout. Eventually, Starbucks' customers will be able to make purchases through the Pay with Square app, which uses GPS technology to alert clerks when customers have entered the store and loads their photo and name automatically into the register. In order to complete the transaction, customers simply state their name and the app will charge the linked card. The potential for a faster check-out experience is a big benefit to such a high-volume retailer. Although Square has not yet entered the loyalty space, it's conceivable that customer purchase details could be made available to the merchant. In theory, a consumer could walk by a Starbucks' location and be offered a $1 off a favourite beverage. A consumer could even walk into the store and have the intensely personalized experience of just asking for his or her “usual.” That instant personalisation aligns with Starbucks' goal of creating an experience around a cup of coffee. It also could give a caffeinated jolt to the US mobile payments movement as the m-wallet becomes more integrated into a daily habit for millions.</p>

Coffee takes a Backseat in Kraft’s Split,"Kraft is splitting into two separate entities - Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International, which becomes official on 1 October 2012. This fundamental transformation is likely to cause short term confusion and upheaval although the new entities will look to become more agile and focused in their core categories.

This fundamental transformation is likely to cause short term confusion and upheaval although the new entities will look to become more agile and focused in their core categories. The key objective of the transformation seems to be focused on developing the snacking business for Mondelez, whilst coffee appears to be a secondary category. To this end, the potential selloff of parts of its coffee businesses cannot be ruled out. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The ownership of the coffee brands is not straight forward, with some subject to licencing agreements whilst others will have split ownership. Kraft Foods Group Inc will have the rights to Maxwell House and Gevalia throughout North America and Latin America, whilst Mondelez will own them in rest of the world. Inevitably, this split of ownership can create complications, particularly in the short term and similarly managing the licensing agreements will be a challenge. Mondelez, for example will own Tassimo and grant Kraft Foods Group Inc the 10-year renewal license to use the trademark in the US, Canada and Caribbean. </p>
<h3>Mondelez focused on building a snacking powerhouse, rather than coffee</h3>
<p>Mondelez will own a string of leading brands in various categories in complex geographies including both developed and developing markets. Beverages would only account for 17% of Mondelez's revenue – very much a secondary category. In the literature surrounding the split, the company has emphasised the focus on snacking; for example, it stated that the strategic priority for the key growth markets of India and China will be chocolate and biscuits respectively. The underlying message appears to be that coffee will receive less attention from its new parents, which is not to say that coffee does not have potential. In overall coffee Mondelez will be ranked second in Europe and Asia Pacific, and third in Europe in the fast growing coffee pods category. Competition is fierce though and to maintain or grow share it cannot afford to lose focus.  </p>
<h3>Kraft Foods Group Inc could do more with coffee</h3>
<p>Similarly, less focus has been made of coffee operations for Kraft Foods Group, where despite its strong presence there is the sense it could be doing more. Notably, whilst Green Mountain Coffee Roaster and Nespresso are expanding rapidly in the US coffee pod category, Tassimo's potential did not seem fully exploited as it underperformed the market. With approximately 1% of category share in 2011, Tassimo is a minor pod brand in the US and it also lost share to rivals in consecutive years, despite strength in the smaller Canadian market. </p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much additional focus coffee will achieve following the split, but a key barometer of this could be whether Kraft Foods Group Inc pushes Maxwell House in the leading coffee growth market of Brazil. Kraft has hesitated making an entry into Brazil, resulting in a negligible market share in the most attractive emerging market. It seems like Kraft's hesitation to enter Brazil is related to focus given to other businesses, notably the acquisition and integration of Cadbury, which has led to this split. </p>
<p>The prospect of Kraft Foods Group Inc or Mondelez's selling their coffee brands can still not be ruled out given coffee seems to be a secondary focus. Therefore, Kraft's split may also create a buying opportunity for ambitious coffee companies such as Tata Global Beverages Ltd and JM Smucker. </p>

The first series of trends was linked to large filtered coffee machines and espressos made on large-sized devices in bars and homes. The second wave marked the entrance of big, creamy lattes, served on cardboard cups, brought by shops like Starbucks and currently still expanding across the region. </p>
<p>This has been followed by a third wave leading many Americans to say &ldquo;coffee is the new wine.&rdquo; Enjoying its taste, tasting events and the quest for excellence go along with a redefinition of the very concept of coffee shops: a place where leisure and getting together are mixed with work.</p>

    <li>Capsules, the industrial version of a new phenomenon;</li>
    <li>The American way reaches Latin America;</li>

</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>American author Mark Pendergrast, author of &ldquo;Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How it Transformed Our World&rdquo; summarises the shift in the style of coffee consumption during the past few decades with one word: sophistication. These changes took place in three waves, each generating and spreading consumption trends. These three waves are experienced at the same time in most Latin American countries. The first one is marked by simple coffee machines with filters, which allow for the &ldquo;making&rdquo; of large amounts of coffee with a few grams. Thus, coffee shops served as a temporary stopgap people only frequented to fulfil their basic food needs.</p>
<p>The second wave was related to the expansion of large chains such as Starbucks, McDonalds Caf&eacute; and several dozen other firms in each country. Its main product was large-sized coffee, with cr&egrave;me, chocolate and caramel aggregates. For experts, from then onwards, the sophistication of coffee as a product began, although not in its culture: coffee shops were still seen as a stopgap. However, they began to be revamped as a venue for leisure. </p>
<p>As for the third wave, which has emerged during the past two years and is in full swing, it may be summarised in a phrase: &ldquo;Coffee is the new wine.&rdquo; In other words, the product&rsquo;s array of varieties and origins expands and it is consumed as a cult product, aiming to please all senses. From this point, caf&eacute;s become a destination in themselves &ndash; as the settings for the convergence of leisure, meetings with others and even work.</p>
<h3>The impact of the &ldquo;third wave&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The third wave of coffee consumption began in cities such as New York, San Francisco and Miami, and it is currently expanding across South American cities such as Bogot&aacute;, S&atilde;o Paulo and Buenos Aires. It started with baristas, in small shops, whose owners and consumers began to take note of the coffee&rsquo;s taste, its origin, how it was roasted, prepared and the cup it was served in. &ldquo;Consumers became aware of the fact that with just a little more money they could get some really good coffee,&rdquo; explains Pendergrast. Increasing interest in coffee spawned its own supply; therefore, more and more cities in the region feature two new kinds of coffee shops: homemade roasters and the so-called &ldquo;coffee caves,&rdquo; where coffee is seen as &ldquo;the new black gold&rdquo; and people read not Sunday paper magazines but specialist coffee books.</p>
<p>Coffee caves are small coffee shops for &ldquo;purists&rdquo; born in large urban areas, especially in the USA. In them, coffee is either espresso or created through &ldquo;experimentation&rdquo; with Chemex and Aeropress, two simple, prestigious coffee-machine brands. Some of these places expanded and now offer varieties such as ristretto, dolce, luongo or decaffeinated coffee. The best brands come from New York, like Stumptown (awarded best coffee roaster in the United States), Joe, Blue Bottle and Think. There are so many of them that a New York Coffee Guide appeared in 2012. The trend is expanding; even in countries such as Argentina, small firms set out to compete with brands. &ldquo;I know more than 20 types of coffee &ndash; that&rsquo;s 20 times more than six months ago, all thanks to this place,&rdquo; says Juan, who consumes Caf&eacute; Puerto Blest, an Argentinean brand that makes its own blends and hands leaflets explaining the features of each type of coffee.</p>
<h3>Capsules, the industrial version of a new phenomenon</h3>
<p>Sophistication and the quest for the best coffee have also reached homes in the form of capsules. In almost every nation in the Americas &ndash; except for the USA and Canada &ndash; this way of consuming coffee is relatively recent. Models of coffee machine such as Pixies Stainless Steel or Lattissima Passion Red have been available for sale for just a couple of years, priced between US$100 and US$2,000. These products have earned their place in consumer electronics and home appliance shops.</p>
<p>Nespresso is the best-known brand in the plastic capsule segment. In the USA and Canada, Starbucks launched its own capsule system, named Verismo. Another trend on the rise regarding capsules is house brands, which may be used on Nespresso machines; Sara Lee is one of the most popular among these. The rise of coffee machines has been rapid in almost every country; in Argentina, capsule coffee machines accounted for just 6% of the market in 2010, but they reached 20% in 2011 and surpassed 30% only a year later, according to an article in newspaper La Naci&oacute;n citing market sources.</p>
<p>Do these devices compete with caf&eacute;s? Certain changes in habits seem to indicate this especially in working environments. In North America and certain Latin American capitals, offices have begun to transform into &ldquo;meeting places&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;workplaces&rdquo; thanks to the rise of home-office practices. A simple station with coffee pods and a comfortable, intimate space will do for turning office space into a de facto coffee shop. &ldquo;It is more intimate and comfortable, there is no noise and coffee is just as good, if not better,&rdquo; says Soledad, a 32-year-old Google Argentina employee to Euromonitor International, citing journalists and analysts of &ldquo;corporate coffee.</p>

<h3>The American way reaches Latin America</h3>
<p>The second wave, brought by the expansion of large coffee-shop chains such as Starbucks, also had its share of novelty. Firstly, these brands are expanding throughout Latin America with surprising success. In August 2013, Starbucks announced its arrival in Colombia, where it expects to open about 50 stores by 2018 through Alsea, which operates 492 Starbucks shops in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, most of them opened during the past five years. In Argentina, the first shop opened in 2008; as of last June, the chain had 64 shops - projected to reach 150 in the mid-term, according to the company.</p>
<p>The arrival of these shops changed the social aspect of caf&eacute; culture in Latin America in two ways: on one hand, it attracted young people to them; on the other hand, it transformed caf&eacute;s into workstations. Inspired by remote workers from San Francisco and New York, who run their companies from a computer at Starbucks, coffee shops began expanding throughout the region as a work venue. To do so, the only thing needed was comfortable sofas and tables with multiple power connections and a key element: free Wi-Fi, This attracted thousands of young workers, who now spend a significant part of their day working from a coffee shop. </p>

<h3>The difference between importer and producer countries</h3>
<p>According to the International Coffee Organisation (ICO), five of the world&rsquo;s biggest coffee producers are located in the Americas. Brazil (accounting for almost one third of global production) and Colombia are the most important growers, followed by Honduras, Guatemala and Peru and to a lesser degree by Ecuador and Mexico. Consumption patterns vary in these countries, as well as the awareness on the products, bean types and production methods, tending to be quite high in all cases. Among producer countries, &ldquo;handmade roasters&rdquo; are becoming popular. These are small shops that create special blends, competing with the more &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; brands producing &ldquo;torrados&rdquo; (roasted coffee with sugar).</p>
<p>Another feature of these markets is that they are slowly beginning to appreciate sustainable production processes and fair trade. The Fair Trade stamp and the rules for Ethical Practices on Coffee Growing (EPCG) have started to become mandatory among local citizens, who are showing heightened awareness of the issue. Lastly, consumption in these places goes far beyond the average, as the price of high-quality, highly pure coffee is much lower than in importer nations.</p>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>Large-sized North American companies are looking for ways to improve their service in response to the increasingly sophisticated tastes of their consumers. In the United States, McDonald&rsquo;s announced investments of US$6.5 million to improve its coffee. The company is also considering opening McCaf&eacute;s in several countries; these shops serve special, high-quality blends supplied by local producers. Such a trend, which is also expanding towards Latin America, is not just a response to an increasingly sophisticated style of coffee consumption &ndash; it also reflects a change in social habits. Costlier, more refined products will push up profitability because of the hours-long, expanded visits of remote workers.</p>

Analyst Pulse: Global Patterns in Coffee Consumption,"To understand regional trends in hot drinks consumption and preferences,Passport Survey reached out to Euromonitor International’s global network of analysts from 80+ countries.","<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For many, the consumption of hot caffeinated beverages is an important social ritual and a workplace institution. The popularity of these hot beverages is often influenced by regional culture &ndash; tea is prevalent in the United Kingdom and throughout much of the Eastern hemisphere, espresso is popular in Continental Europe, and drip coffee is common in the United States and Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current regional preferences are no doubt informed by these traditions, but may be changing in an environment of increasing globalization and cultural exchange. The spread of multinational coffee retailers has exposed many global consumers to a wide variety of hot beverages. To better understand the impact of this globalization on regional hot drinks preferences, Euromonitor turned to its global network of analysts and asked about hot drinks trends in their respective countries. Re-evaluating regional consumption patterns, whether they cement traditional habits or indicate that consumer tastes are expanding, can give retailers and manufacturers insights into how consumers in each region can be best served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Patterns in regional hot drink consumption</h3>
<h3>The overwhelming majority of analysts frequently enjoy some type of hot drink</h3>
<p>Overall, hot drinks consumption is very high among Euromonitor analysts. Ninety-five percent of analysts regularly drink either coffee or tea and nearly three-fifths report drinking both, suggesting that there is a great deal of overlap in the markets for each type of beverage. Three-quarters of analysts drink tea regularly, with green, black and herbal teas being consumed in roughly equal measure. Coffee consumption is similarly high, with greater variation in the types of coffee enjoyed by analysts.</p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenote"">Note: &nbsp;Showing percent of analysts who report regularly drinking one of the beverages listed above. In this context, Chai refers to &lsquo;masala chai,&rsquo; black tea that is flavoured with a mix of spices (typically ginger, cardamom, and cloves, among others) and often brewed in milk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>While most of the world drinks espresso and instant coffee, North Americans prefer drip and pod-insert coffee</h3>
<p>Coffee drinkers throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America primarily drink espresso and instant coffee. North America is the only region in which drip coffee is more popular than instant, and the only region with a substantial portion of analysts drinking coffee made with pod inserts. This may be due to a preference for &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; coffee; pod inserts allow coffee to be freshly brewed in single servings, and in North America these inserts dominate the market space that instant coffee occupies elsewhere.</p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenote"">Note: &nbsp;Showing percent of analysts who report regularly drinking one of the above types of coffee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Most analysts get their coffee from caf&eacute;s or at home</h3>
<p>Understanding how consumers obtain their coffee can help reveal the relative size of markets for prepared coffee and coffee supplies for homes and offices. Most analysts who drink coffee buy it at caf&eacute;s or make it at home (and often do both). The likelihood that a caf&eacute; customer also buys coffee to brew at home makes these shops an attractive venue to offer products for home use. Starbucks, for example, sells an extensive line of coffee in their stores for customers to brew at home. The retailer will even grind whole beans on-site for customers to take home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts in every region except Latin America are likely to obtain coffee at work or school, making these institutions important coffee buyers in their own right. The market for business-to-business coffee supply has the most potential in developed countries, where analysts are more likely to get coffee at work than their colleagues in emerging countries. This may be due to schools and employers in emerging markets not providing coffee, rather than choice on the part of consumers in these countries, who are just as eager to drink coffee outside of work as consumers in developed economies.</p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenote"">Note: &nbsp;Showing percent of analysts who report regularly obtaining coffee at one of the above three locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Coffee add-ins</h3>
<h3>Most coffee drinkers add dairy products or sweetener</h3>
<p>Artificial sweeteners and non-dairy creamers may offer fewer calories and longer shelf life, but analysts tend to prefer their natural counterparts. Use of artificial ingredients and non-dairy milks is almost non-existent among analysts outside of the Western hemisphere. Less than one third of analysts in any region take their coffee without any milk or cream, and in Asia black coffee is all but unheard of. </p>

<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablenote"">Note: &nbsp;Showing percent of analysts who report regularly adding one of these six most frequently used ingredients to their coffee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overlap between the restaurant and home coffee markets may provide synergistic opportunities for retailers poised to offer both types of products. At a high level, these retailers should keep in mind that coffee preferences vary by region. The instant coffee and espresso formats are widely used throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America. However, retailers looking to make an impact in the North American market should consider offering products compatible with drip and pod insert coffee makers. Many coffee drinkers in Latin America and emerging countries do not yet obtain their coffee at work or school, suggesting that there may be room in the future for commercial coffee suppliers to expand in these markets. At a minimum, caf&eacute;s and restaurants should ensure that natural milk, cream and sugar are available for their consumers, as these are the most popular coffee add-ins.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Analyst Pulse Survey</h3>
<p>In 2011, Euromonitor International began designing, executing and analysing its own surveys in order to expand its trusted global research.&nbsp; This is part of a series of articles presenting the results of its Analyst Pulse surveys.&nbsp; In Analyst Pulse surveys, Passport Survey reaches out to Euromonitor&rsquo;s network of in-country&nbsp; and in-house researchers around the world in order to find out more about current consumer attitudes and habits on a wide variety of topics, from economic outlook to daily activities. The Survey team collaborates with Euromonitor industry managers to identify topics and design questions. In January 2014, 241 researchers answered questions related to their typical hot drinks consumptions. These questions were created in partnership with the Hot Drinks team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>More on the sample: our global analyst network</h3>
<p>Analyst Pulse survey results differ from other survey data cited on Passport Survey (eg, findings from the Annual Study or Global Youth) and should be interpreted with some caution.&nbsp; Analyst Pulse responses reflect the opinions and habits of several hundred of Euromonitor International&rsquo;s in-country analysts and in-house researchers around the world.&nbsp; As such, results reflect a great degree of geographic, economic, and cultural diversity among educated consumers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Euromonitor International&rsquo;s researchers do not constitute a random sample of consumers in a given country or across the globe, so their responses do not necessarily represent the opinions of a broader population of consumers.&nbsp; Passport Survey presents their attitudes and behaviours in order to provide starting points for potential further investigations and sparks of tactical insight.</p>",263088,1,263088,2014-03-26 19:01:22,304541,36,2014-03-26 19:17:00,SurveyArticle

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Coffee consumption is a tradition deeply embedded in Arab and African culture, and as well as the ubiquitous instant coffee, there is now a distinct emergence of interest in espresso-based coffee consumed in modern, Westernised coffee shops. While instant coffee continues to dominate coffee consumption in these two regions, with Nescafé virtually synonymous with instant coffee and a leading lifestyle brand in hot drinks, consumption of fresh coffee is growing. In 2013, Nestlé launched Nescafe Arabiana, which it describes as a “100% instant Arabic coffee product, prepared with premium-quality green coffee beans that are combined with cardamom and other natural flavours”. Meanwhile, products such as the Aeropress Coffee Maker or the Minibru Coffee Mug are bringing coffee culture to offices with fresh filter coffee while, for hotter climates, the Hamilton Beach Personal Iced Coffee Brewer “will take consumers to their own personal beach wherever they are”.</p>

<h3>Touba coffee dominates Dakar</h3>

<p>The website eatyourworld.com reports from Dakar, where “Between the ubiquitous roving Nescafe vendors and innumerable café Touba stands”, Senegal emerges as a prime coffee-drinking culture.  “Nescafe gets the job done, of course, and buying a tiny plastic cup of sweet, mixed-to-order instant coffee from a mobile cart is always a novel pleasure…but café Touba is at least more interesting and, at times, pretty tasty”. Touba offers coffee with a kick: the coffee beans are ground with djar, an African black pepper said to have stomach-settling and aphrodisiacal qualities, and is served with a lot of sugar (no milk). Travellers to the Ivory Coast, Senegal and Mali also report that French colonisation has left behind a number of cafés selling a very good café au lait. </p>

<h3>European and US-style café culture in Israel </h3>

<p>Café culture is booming in Israel, with travel website Blacktomato.com informing us that “You’ll be sure to get your caffeine fix pretty much anywhere you go in Israel. From Jaffa to Jerusalem cafes have sprung up all over the country – most of which serve all manner of drinks and light snacks as well as the local favourite ‘Café Affuch’ or ‘upside down coffee’….Many of the most popular cafes are expanding into the dining arena and embracing new food trends”.</p>

<p>In a country with no shortage of high quality cafés to choose from, the opening of Cofix in Tel Aviv at the start of October 2013 where everything on the menu costs the equivalent of a pound turned into an unexpectedly big event. Many patrons learnt of the launch through social networking and WhatsApp. Surprisingly, the café appeals to the well-heeled as well as students and the impoverished middle classes. Customers such as high tech executive, Saguy, waiting for warm pastries and fresh-squeezed juice who explains: “Nowadays, no salary is enough… Wherever you can save, you save. I wouldn’t bring a date here, but I’d come here before the date”.  </p>

<h3>Middle Eastern cafés herald a new social culture  </h3>

<p>July 2014 saw the launch of Sabado Coffee Club in Dubai. Travel website timeoutdubai.com informs that “while coming together to drink coffee [is] one of the Region’s oldest social activities, in recent years in Dubai, coffee has taken on a new colour with informed networks of coffee makers and consumers”. The Dubai-born group aims at tasting premium roasts from around the world and socialising over a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>But not everyone is happy about the burgeoning modern café culture. A number of politicians in Kuwait have alleged that coffee shops that allow unmarried men and women to sit together are “corrupting” the country’s morals. According to the Kuwait Times newspaper, these comments “triggered a heated debate on Kuwaiti social media, focusing on the extent of individual freedom in a country where society and families have a preponderant status”. Speaking to the newspaper, university professor Shafiq Ghabra said: “It’s a blatant invasion of privacy. People who don’t want to go to mixed coffee shops don’t have to”.</p>

<h3>Trendy coffee shops a feature in South African cities</h3>

<p>Until a very few years ago, instant coffee was virtually the only option available in South Africa’s cafés. If you ordered a cup of coffee, you might have been able to get a filter coffee as an alternative. Not so now: According to an article on the website Travel.cnn.com from March 2013, specialist coffee shops did nearly four times the business in the country in 2012 than in 2007, with Cape Town the epicentre of this coffee revolution. “These days, to-go cups from the right coffee shop are displayed like choice accessories”, Rebecca L. Weber observes in her article. One old-school coffee shop owner, Anthony Swarz of Anthony's Golden Cup, inks the end of apartheid to the demand for better quality coffee. According to the travel website Fabsearch.com, Camps Bay has become the hotspot of the Cape’s café culture, with “Cafe Caprice…a savvy-insider, cool place to eat in Cape Town, Camps Bay”, and Wallpaper magazine praises Jason Lilley's Bakery and café as a “hotspot bakery/café in Cape Town”.</p>

<p>Vida e Caffe is a leading new chain of ‘espresso bars’ which have expanded beyond trendy Cape Town to open cafés in Johannesburg and Durban, as well as in Kenya, Botswana, Mauritius and Ghana, with 67 coffee shops to date. The chain’s mission is modest enough: “We strive to serve the best espresso, or espresso-based caffe, as well as offer the best atmosphere and food on the planet”.</p>

<h3>Café culture encroaching on traditional tea-houses in Morocco</h3>

<p>Costa Coffee, a subsidiary of UK hospitality giant Whitbread PLC, has plans to expand its chain of coffee houses to Morocco. Andy Marshall, managing director of Costa Coffee International Franchise, said: “We envisage a significant store opening programme over the coming years.” According to Marshall, “Morocco is a market where there is already an established coffee culture”. Euromonitor International data states that cafés recorded value sales of US$905 million in Morocco during 2012, with chained cafés accounting for just US$2.6 million of this. An example for the burgeoning café scene is Marrakech’s Djemaa El Fna square which, in the evenings, turns into a massive open-air restaurant with local cafes setting up stalls. In Tangiers’ established cafés such as the Café Colon in the Medina or Café de Paris, the traditional ‘the à la menthe’ (mint tea) has traditionally been served alongside strong Arabic coffee, and is now competing with espresso, latte and cappuccino.</p>

<h3>Mobile cyber cafés in South Africa</h3>

<p>“The MTN eStreet mobile internet café will travel around the country, especially to the often forgotten communities outside the urban centres. The café will ensure that new and existing subscribers get the most out of our world-class network, smart technologies and online solutions,” says Brian Gouldie, Chief Marketing Officer at MTN, South Africa’s mobile operator. MTN has launched the eStreet mobile internet café project, aiming to give clients 24/7 internet connectivity. This initiative will be particularly focused on rural areas where internet connections are sparse.</p>

<h3>Social life flourishes in Amman’s state-of-the-art cafés</h3>

<p>According to the blog BeAmman.com, coffee shop Majnoon Qahwa is “one of the coolest and most interesting new spots in Amman”. It roasts its own coffee, which comes from four different countries – El Salvador, Guatemala, Brazil and Yemen. It also sports a cold drip brewer, “where ice water drips into the ground coffee for over 12 hours to give a concentrated cold coffee”. Qishr, a Yemeni drink is made from the husks of coffee beans, which are soaked in hot water for eight hours.</p>

<p>The Jordan Times newspaper recently reported that a growing number of locals are playing card games. University student Laith Muthana commented that many played cards due to the lack of entertainment options in the city. “The only thing people can do in Amman is sit in a café, so we need to do something to pass the time while we drink coffee or smoke sheesha,” he said. </p>

<h3>Bringing the coffee back to Africa</h3>

<p>Since 2010, Kenya has seen an increased trend towards coffee shops, as consumers became more aware of coffee specialities such as latté, cappuccino and macchiato. An emerging urban coffee culture was a boon to local coffee producers and led to increased competition between coffee shops, with Kenyan foodservice outlets increasing in urban centres. In just a few years, big names such as Dormans and Java had to contend with new entrants such as Savannah, Coffee World, Kahawa, Kapital Coffee, The Coffee House and The Mug, as well as many others which have become concentrated in city centres. Dormans, which according to Euromonitor International is the overall leader in fresh coffee retail sales, has 11 branches in the busiest areas of Nairobi and Mombasa, whilst Java has 10. During the same time, American coffee shops such as the US Starbucks chain and UK chain Costa Coffee began to spring up across the Middle East and North Africa, in response to the changing lifestyles of young consumers in North Africa and Egypt.</p>

<h3>Outlook</h3>

<p>Specialist coffee shop chains have identified Africa and the Middle East as a vibrant market. Euromonitor International predicts strong growth for both cafés and specialist coffee shops in this region over the medium term, as urbanisation and outlet expansion makes them accessible to more consumers. Specialist coffee shops will prove attractive particularly to women, more so than the traditional tea houses and cafés which remain a male domain, and also because they offer a varied coffee menu, food and cakes.</p>

<p>Preference for experience over possessions is one of the eight trends which we see as combining to create <a data-customcontentid=""10162"">The New Consumerism</a>. The New Consumerism sees today’s consumers reassessing their priorities and increasingly asking themselves what they truly value: Why own something that I only use sporadically? Why accumulate more belongings when I could be out experiencing life? Why pay for space I don’t use?</p>
