Beer giants circle Bavaria,Speculation is mounting about the likey purchase of Latin American giant Empresarial Bavaria by one of the global brewers.,"<p>Speculation is mounting about the likey purchase of Latin American giant Empresarial Bavaria by one of the global brewers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Following weeks of speculation, industry experts expect Grupo Empresarial Bavaria to appoint advisers to aid its sale. The company, which could sell for more than US$5 billion, would be an excellent acquisition for whichever company wins the bidding, despite poor annual results for 2004.</p>
<h4>Good catch</h4>
<p>Despite making an operating loss of COP80.68 billion (US$130,000) in 2004, compared to a net profit of COP101.40 billion (US$350,000) in 2003, there is little to worry potential buyers. The loss was due to high operational expenses, such as increased advertising and foreign exchange rates. Volume sales of beer and malt beverages remaind strong, growing nearly 5%.</p>
<p>Bavaria dominates beer sales in four countries, Colombia, Peru, Panama and Ecuador, whose combined volume sales account for over 11% of the 22 billion litres of beer sold in Latin America in 2004. All the countries, with the exception of Panama, will see double digit growth in the medium term as they recover from economic problems. With the exception of InBev and Molson Coors, none of the big multinationals have a major presence in the region with all having less than a 1% volume share.</p>
<h4>No fit state</h4>
<p>Of the multinationals, both Carlsberg and Molson Coors are the least likely to bid. Carlsberg is not in a strong position after a poor performance in 2004. It also has a high level of debt caused by the purchase of Holsten, which it is still trying to integrate. Molson Coors will not bid, despite the purchase fitting in well with its Brazilian brewing arm, Kaiser. The new company is still coming to terms with the merger, completed in early 2005.</p>
<p>InBev would also struggle to make a successful bid despite being the obvious strategic fit with its dominant positions in Brazil and Argentina. If the company did bid it would run into anti-trust opposition. The company is also in a weak financial position after a number of acquisitions in Germany, China and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch is too busy focusing on fast growing emerging markets, such as China and Southeast Asia, to be concerned with entering the relatively slow growing Latin American region.</p>
<h4>More sober proposition</h4>
<p>SABMiller is in a strong financial position having turned round its Miller arm. It has developed an interest in Latin America with the purchase of Bevco, which has concerns in Honduras and El Salvador, the same part of the region where Bavaria is strong. The only question is whether the acquisition could over stretch the UK based giant.</p>
<p>It has made a number of acquisitions in developing markets such as China, Asia, Eastern Europe and India and this purchase would tip the balance of the company in the favour of these higher risk markets, making future growth less stable. It could be advised to focus on more mature Western markets.</p>
<p>Heineken would also be keen to bid. The company has a limited presence outside Europe and North America. It has failed to make an impact in Asia Pacific compared to the other global giants. Latin America would be a prime opportunity for it to expand outside its core markets. However Heineken’s high level of debt could restrict it in a bidding war.</p>
<p>The other potential bidder is Scottish & Newcastle. The company would be interested in Bavaria as a defensive move, bolstering it against takeover attempts by larger global players, such as SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch.</p>
<p>All three are rumoured to be serious about making offers, with both Heineken and Scottish & Newcastle executives said to have visited Bavaria’s operations and SABMiller to have held talks with the company earlier in 2005. SABMiller would be the most likely winner, as it is carrying less debt than the other two. Whoever wins will have a strong position with which to expand further.</p>
<p>The auction will be the first of a number of sales of brewing operations in the region in the short term. The Mexican Government is predicted to split the FEMSA and Grupo Modelo beer duopoly in the next five years. FEMSA may sell its brewing arm (Latin America’s third biggest brewer) as it focuses more on soft drinks and pays down debt after its purchase of the Panamco soft drinks group. In addition, Empresas Polar may sell its leading Venezuelan brewing arm due to poor economic conditions in the country.</p>",436,1,156,2005-03-07 16:55:54,32333,39,2005-03-03 00:00:00,IWArticle
Molson Coors joins Russian beer queue,"Molson Coors will launch its premium Coors Fine Light lager in Russia by mid 2005, but it will be brewed locally.","<p>Molson Coors will launch its premium Coors Fine Light lager in Russia by mid 2005, but it will be brewed locally.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Molson Coors is the latest international brewer to launch one of its foreign brands in Russia to take advantage of one of the most dynamic beer markets in the world. So far in 2005, Fosters Group and Diageo have announced agreements to have their brands brewed and sold in the country. Brewed by Pivovarni Ivana Taranova ZAO, Coors Fine Light will initially be sold in Moscow and St Petersburg.</p>
<h4>Premium drives Russian beer</h4>
<p>In 2004, premium lager accounted for 26% of the 8.1 billion litres sold. Premium brands drove beer sales, growing by over 19% in volume terms compared to the overall sector growth of 7%. This is primarily due to increasing affluence in Russia; disposable income has nearly doubled between 2000 and 2005; just less than 10% of this disposable income is spent on alcoholic drinks. Growth is likely to continue, with premium lager forecast to grow by almost 50% in volume by 2009, over double the rate of the total sector and accounting for a third of total beer sales.</p>
<p>Local lagers such as Sibirskaya Korona and Baltika dominated sales in 2003, while foreign brands such as Miller Genuine Draft and Holsten accounted for only 7% of premium lager volume sales. This is mainly due to brand loyalty and the previous high costs of foreign brands which tended to be imported and thus much more expensive.</p>
<h4>Too Light to make an impact</h4>
<p>Coors Fine Light will struggle to make much of an impact. Despite the brand’s competitive price, strong initial marketing support of US$4 million in 2005 and launch in the two cities with the biggest consumption of premium lager Russia. The brand will compete against a plethora of other foreign brands, all of which are better established. Many consumers in the two cities have already become loyal to certain brands. St Petersburg and Moscow beer markets were quite close to the saturation with beer consumption of 79 and 75 litres per person respectively in 2003. National beer consumption is expect to reach 70 litres per head in the medium term, which means the two major cities are unlikely to exceed 85 litres per capita consumption by then.</p>
<h4>A drop in the ocean</h4>
<p>The heavy marketing support is highly unlikely to be as helpful as before, due to the ban on alcohol advertising on television and radio between 7am and 10pm. In addition, the brand will struggle with distribution. In both Moscow and St Petersburg the country’s leading brewer Baltika dominates distribution. Molson Coors’ Russian partner PIT was the sixth ranked brewer in 2003 with less than a 4% share.</p>",436,1,156,2005-04-19 09:50:23,33142,39,2005-04-01 00:00:00,IWArticle
InBev brews up beer coup in Peru,"InBev is to launch a new beer in Peru to take on Backus, a subsidiary of Bavaria that dominates the sector.","<p>InBev is to launch a new beer in Peru to take on Backus, a subsidiary of Bavaria that dominates the sector.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The launch is part of the company's strategy to expand further in Latin America, away from its Brazilian and Argentinean heartland. InBev's as yet unnamed beer, will be positioned as a standard lager due to its dominance of the sector. It will be tough to break into the market due to Backus' extensive distribution network and the strong loyalty to its brands</p>
<h3>Big and wanting to get bigger </h3>
<p>InBev was comfortably the biggest brewer in Latin America in 2003 with nearly 27% of total volume sales. The company's strength was based on its 67% share of the regions biggest market Brazil and the 14% share in Argentina. InBev's has been looking at expanding further north in the region for a while. Earlier in 2005, it had been in talks to take over Bavaria. With the company still having to digest its previous merger and Bavaria's preference for an alliance the possibility of a takeover seems to have receded.</p>
<h3>Small and not getting much bigger </h3>
<p>The Peruvian beer sector grew by just under 1% to around 536 million litres in 2004, down from a late 1990's peak of 650 million litres, after tough economic conditions in the country. Sales are dominated by standard lager, which accounted for 99% of volume sales in 2004. This is due to the large economic disparity in wealth distribution, which in 2000 saw the bottom 10% of the population having less than 1% and the top 10% having almost 40% of the Peru's wealth.</p>
<p>InBev will have the benefit of its soft drinks distribution network, as it distributes the Pepsi brand but will need a long, sustained marketing campaign to make an impact. Yet with growth of less than 10% in the medium term it will be hard going.</p>",436,1,156,2005-06-08 15:45:29,34476,39,2005-05-05 00:00:00,IWArticle
Heineken adds more flavour to French beer,"Heineken has launched a draught lager and three new flavoured beers in France, targeted at the on-trade.","<p>Heineken has launched a draught lager and three new flavoured beers in France, targeted at the on-trade.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Heineken's launches, which includes a new lime tequila variant of its Desperados, green tea and lime passion flavoured beers, are an attempt to increase its share of the declining French beer sector. It also hopes reinvigorate the sales of flavoured beer, which drove growth of premium lager in 2003. The targeting of the on-trade is a good way to drive value growth in a shrinking market.</p>
<h3>Losing the fizz </h3>
<p>Beer in France declined by just under 2% in 2004, to around 2.1 billion litres. With the exception of 2003 and its hot summer, beer has been in decline since the start of the decade, caused by continued restrictions on alcohol advertising and consumers increasing preference for soft drinks. Flavoured lagers performed strongly in 2003, driven by Heineken's Desperados, which accounted for over 5% of the 600 million litres of premium lager. Flavoured lagers have proved popular amongst young drinkers looking for different flavour experiences.</p>
<p>The company is focusing on the on-trade as it will give it better margins on its products than the off-trade where consumers prefer shopping at discount outlets. In 2004, on-trade volume sales declined by just under 2%, slightly faster than the off-trade, but value sales in both fell by exactly the same rate at just under 3%. The problem is going to become exacerbated later in 2005 with the recent passing of the Loi Galland, which relaxes government restrictions on pricing and will lead to more price wars, in the off-trade.</p>
<h3>Spicing up sales </h3>
<p>Heineken could be successful with the new flavoured variants, helping increase its share of the sector. Premium lager is the only subsector likely to see growth in the medium term, up 3% and 5% in volume and value terms compared to an overall decline of nearly 3% and 1% respectively. Drinking beer is likely to become more of a qualitative occasion, connected with the discovery of new tastes and flavours. The downside will be that the company will have to continue to innovate with new flavours as consumers tire of the older ones.</p>",436,1,156,2005-06-08 15:48:00,34511,39,2005-05-06 00:00:00,IWArticle
"Spirits, beers and wine on-line.","The Internet has revolutionised the way many products are sold, but for the sale of alcoholic beverages it remains a relatively underexploited medium, not least because direct sales pose a significant regulatory problem.

And while direct-to-consumer sales remain unlikely to develop in the immediate future, the prospects for online transactions between drinks producers and their trade customers look somewhat rosier. Parita Chitakasem, Global Spirits Analyst at Euromonitor, discusses the issues involved.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Doing business over the Internet is becoming increasingly popular in many countries, with a wide range of goods and services now sold directly to consumers online. Yet even in those countries where online shopping is widespread, the sale of alcoholic beverages over the Net is still very much in its infancy, with retailers struggling to find a business model that combines convenience and choice for their customers with sustainable profitability. </p>
<p>The very nature of alcoholic products makes Internet selling a tough business. Beer, for example, is primarily an impulse item bought for immediate consumption, and offers little in the way of profit margin to the retailer, unless bought in substantial volumes. The time and cost associated with online buying therefore makes it an unattractive option for many consumers. </p>
<p>Being more expensive, spirits offer more in the way of margin potential, but their high alcohol content has traditionally made them the main focus of concern about how to regulate online sales. Furthermore, as spirits tend to be purchased when and as required, waiting even a few days for an order made via the Internet is generally considered unacceptable. No surprise, then, that the Internet accounts for just 0.6 per cent of global spirit sales.</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, it is wine that has to date been the most successful at breaking into the online sales segment. With a relatively low alcohol content, long shelf life, a huge variety of choice and, for premium wines in particular, significant margin potential, wine is ideally suited to distance selling, and all of the most successful online alcohol traders have focused on it.</p>
<p>Yet choosing the right product on which to concentrate is by no means a guarantee of success. There are a large number of other elements that must combine for online alcohol sales to be profitable. </p>
<h4>Internet penetration not necessarily a guarantee for success</h4>
<p>In France, for example, Internet usage levels are high – more than 21 million users in 2003 – and the well-developed food retail sector means that most of the major supermarket chains such as Auchan and Carrefour have their own online shops. Furthermore, as French consumers have become increasingly at ease with online shopping (food and drink purchases accounted for just under 12% of total sales in excess of €2.4 billion in 2002) a number of dedicated wine trading sites have developed. </p>
<p>Among the most successful are wineandco.com (partially owned by the Moët Hennessy drinks group), chateauonline.fr, rouge-blanc.com and nicolas-wines.com (the website of the country's leading chain of wine shops). </p>
<p>Yet in Germany, where Internet penetration is almost as high (around 19 million in 2003) and the retail sector equally developed, there are virtually no online food and drink purchases. Germans are far more price-conscious than their French counterparts, with discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl dominating the market and offering food and drink products at the lowest possible price. As a result, the competitive edge of most online retailers (that they can sell products for less because they have lower overheads) is blunted in the German market. </p>
<p>Furthermore, German consumers seem less prepared to accept requirements such as delivery charges and minimum orders, vital for profitable online shops.</p>
<h4>Fine wine focus in UK</h4>
<p>The other major European market is the UK, where there are more than 22 million regular Internet users in 2003. Britain is also the most eclectic wine market in the world, and the leading export market for almost every wine producer in the Old and New World. Not surprisingly, then, it is wine that is most frequently sold via the Internet in the UK, although the raft of web-based wine shops of the early 1990s has dwindled to just one major player – Virgin Wines, which has around 250,000 customers. </p>
<p>It is perhaps ironic that Britain's new status as a nation of wine drinkers is due largely to the efforts of the major supermarket groups to 'demystify' wine and make it more accessible, since most of the retailers there have had little success with their online businesses. </p>
<p>Market leader Tesco, which picks online shopping orders from stores rather than warehouses like rival Sainsbury's, is able to offer a service which is quick and cheap, and as a result is the supermarket group with the leading share of online alcohol sales (Tesco's total online business is worth around £500m a year, compared to around £145m for Sainsbury's, although neither chain breaks out figures for alcohol sales).</p>
<p>Before the supermarkets turned their marketing might to wine, there was a small but significant market in the UK for premium wines, fuelled primarily by wine clubs. Many of these, which already operated mail order services long before the arrival of the Internet, have continued to offer the same service with online orders, notably companies such as Direct Wines and The Wine Society. These smaller companies are able to successfully compete via the Net by focusing on higher-margin wines aimed at an educated audience. </p>
<p>In a similar vein, upmarket wine sellers such as Berry Bros & Rudd and Bibendum have successfully moved online by focusing on premium varieties, while larger high-street names such as Majestic Wines have emphasised volume over value, with similar levels of success. Indeed, Majestic offers its customers the chance to buy their wine online for collection from its warehouse in Calais (where duty levels are lower and, therefore, wines are cheaper), and will pay for the ferry crossing from the UK for orders in excess of £300. </p>
<h4>Scandinavian monopolies coming under fire </h4>
<p>In countries such as Sweden, where until recently, almost all alcohol purchases had to be carried out through the Systembolaget monopoly, there has been no Internet business at all, not even one run by the state. Some companies did attempt to circumvent the ban on online sales by selling into Sweden from elsewhere, but the country's prohibitive import taxes made these drinks even more expensive than those bought from Systembolaget outlets. </p>
<p>A similar attempt to bypass the state monopoly in Finland has been much more successful, however. Cybeerwine.com is a Spanish company set up in 2002 to offer Finnish consumers an alternative to Alko, the monopoly retailer, selling beverages at just a fraction of the price. </p>
<p>Beer and wine ordered through the site are subject to Spanish duty levels, much lower than those in Finland (beer duty is 10 euro cents per litre at 5% abv, while wine is completely duty free in Spain, compared to respective duties of €1.43 and €1.65 in Finland). However, consumers do have to arrange their own delivery – through a courier service such as UPS, for example – which partially offsets the savings made by bypassing Alko and makes it uneconomical for small orders (though there are no restrictions on the quantities which can be purchased through the site).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the site has been a major success with more than 6,000 orders in Finland since 2002, and the company has begun targeting other countries where oppressive taxes mean that alcohol prices are high, such as the UK and Germany, where it also operates a shop in Bremen, where customers can pick up their purchases free of charge within 72 hours. </p>
<p>The European Commission in 2004 ruled that Swedish rules preventing individuals from ordering alcohol from outside the country without passing through the monopoly were illegal. This decision, based partially on testimony from cybeerwine.com, the company claims, has allowed it to step up its activities there. It claims to have processed 2,000 orders from Swedish consumers already.</p>
<p>Cybeerwine.com also has a burgeoning business in Norway, another country with a state-run monopoly (Vinmonopolet), and where taxes are even higher than in Sweden (indeed, Norwegians flock across the border to buy cheaper alcohol there, just as the Swedes travel to Denmark to do the same). But here it has more competition, with the monopoly running its own online ordering service that has proved to be especially popular in the remoter parts of the country, where it is easier to get alcohol delivered to the door than to travel to the nearest store to buy it.</p>
<p>Despite the growing popularity of the cybeerwine.com service, its future remains far from certain. Finland, Sweden and Denmark have all come in for criticism from the European Commission over their excessively high taxes, and as the gap between alcohol prices in Scandinavia and the rest of the EU continues to narrow, consumers there are likely to opt for a simple visit to their local store rather than ordering online just to save a few kroner.</p>
<p>The company's expansion to the UK markets is also a gamble, for while taxes are relatively high there, the disparity is not as great as with countries such as Sweden, Finland or Norway and as such the costly requirement of arranging shipment via third party (and paying in euros, rather than sterling) effectively cancels out the cost saving of buying from Spain. Furthermore, the Spanish base of the site means that the majority of wines on offer come from that country, a selection that may prove too limited in the long term for British wine drinkers who like to experiment – and who have plenty of other varieties to buy online if they so desire. </p>
<h4>US changes underway</h4>
<p>Changes to restrictive legislation are also being pushed through in the US, where the three-tier system has traditionally prevented producers from selling directly to consumers. Instead, producers had to pass through wholesalers in each state, effectively preventing interstate shipments of alcohol.</p>
<p>But an organisation called Free the Grapes has spearheaded a campaign to change this restrictive system. It argues that allowing direct interstate shipments would improve consumer choice and give the country's 2,000 or so wineries, most of which operate only in their local region, a much better chance of selling their output nationwide.</p>
<p>As a result of fierce lobbying from Free the Grapes and others, 26 states allowed direct shipments across state lines in 2004 – a decade ago, this was possible between just four states. Yet direct shipments are still illegal in more than half the US states, and in some it has now become a felony, making it as serious, in the eyes of the law, to sell a bottle of Chardonnay between states as burglary.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, therefore, online drinks sales in the US are still very limited, operating largely within state lines and, somewhat ironically, run mainly by the major wholesalers that organisations such as Free the Grapes are seeking to bypass. As a result, most online business covers a limited geographical area.</p>
<p>Nor is there much online activity among the leading US grocers, with even the almighty Wal-Mart offering no food or drink brands for sale via its Internet portal. The collapse of the country's first online grocer, webvan.com, in 2001 has done little to encourage further developments in this area.</p>
<h4>Marketing tool</h4>
<p>Despite all these problems, the Web nonetheless plays an important role in the alcohol trade in the US, primarily as a marketing tool. </p>
<p>All the major US alcoholic beverage companies operate websites – indeed, many run several, relating to different brands. These have become key marketing and merchandising tools for the producers, and for brewers in particular.</p>
<p>For example, the budweiser.com site, owned by Anheuser-Busch, has only one relatively small section devoted to the beer itself, with the rest of the site focusing on areas expected to appeal to the brand's core target audience of young drinkers: music, movies and sport. And while the site does contain an online shop, it sells only Budweiser merchandise, not beer. </p>
<p>Spirit makers are also strong in this particular use of the Internet, with companies such as Jack Daniels or Absolut seeing the Web as an extension of their marketing campaigns in magazines, billboards or on TV. Again, though, the online stores feature merchandise rather than the product itself. Indeed, the closest the Jack Daniels site gets to offering visitors a drink is an audio file of a glass being filled with its whiskey!</p>
<p>Even though none of these sites offers the possibility of buying alcohol online, all of them require visitors to be of legal drinking age just to enter, highlighting the biggest barrier to consumer acceptance of online alcohol trading in the US – how to ensure the protection of minors. </p>
<p>The age checks used by most of the marketing sites consist of little more than visitors entering their date of birth or confirming that they are of legal drinking age – measures unlikely to stop determined underage drinkers from visiting the site. Anti-alcohol campaigners argue that even sites that do not sell products need to do more to ensure that underage visitors are protected from their marketing hard sell, as this nonetheless incites purchases through more traditional retail outlets.</p>
<p>Yet many sites that do offer alcohol for sale – mostly those run by small-scale wineries such as amusebouchwines.com or darioush.com – have no age checks at all. Instead, they rely on the delivery company to verify the age of the recipient, a system which opponents argue is open to abuse. </p>
<p>However, with many of the products for sale positioned firmly at the premium end of the market (amusebouchwines.com offers a case of six bottles of Napa Valley Merlot for over $1,000, for example), wineries argue that the chance of them appealing to minors is minimal. </p>
<h4>Growth prospects in emerging markets</h4>
<p>Therefore perhaps it is emerging countries, where the retail market as a whole is not so well developed, which offer the greatest opportunities in the future. How distant that future is, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe and Latin America, for example, the rapid growth of western retail chains like Carrefour or Tesco – leading online grocers in their own home markets – might suggest that the Internet could develop rapidly there as a means of buying alcohol. However, there are a number of factors more likely to hold it back, including low credit and debit card usage, poor Internet usage levels and a general distrust of online sales.</p>
<p>In Asia, the chances look more promising, although not, surprisingly, in the region's most developed economy, Japan. Internet penetration has been relatively slow there, despite the country's technology-friendly image, and so far online alcohol trading has been limited to premium products such as top-end wines and spirits, traditionally popular as corporate gifts. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, the opportunities are mixed. At one extreme, South Korea has a complete ban on Internet sales, designed to protect minors, while at the other, Singapore has rapidly developed as the most important market in the region for online wine sales, as companies leverage the growing awareness of wine's health benefits and its upmarket image. </p>
<h4>B2B vs. B2C</h4>
<p>Another Asian country, Indonesia, has developed Internet sales in a different way. In a country where home Internet usage is very low and the vast majority of alcohol is consumed in bars rather than at home, drinks companies have looked to the Web to facilitate their business with wholesalers and retailers rather than directly with consumers, developing a substantial business-to-business (B2B) operation there. </p>
<p>This particular use of the Internet is increasing in other countries as well. InBev (formerly Interbrew), the Belgian brewer, in 2001 launched a 'one-stop-shop' to provide a full range of services to its professional customers in Belgium, a move since copied by other Belgian brewers such as Alken Maes (Scottish & Newcastle) and other spirits operators.</p>
<p>The advantage of B2B sites is that they are simply an extension of a company's existing business relations with its customers, and as such are relatively inexpensive to operate. Indeed, as technology advances, retail or wholesale customers will be able to replenish stocks automatically using stock keeping or point-of-sale software.</p>
<h4>Niche: the way to go</h4>
<p>For the consumer, alcohol remains an impulse purchase for the most part, something bought as part of a weekly shop or on the way home from work as an indulgence. This makes time-delayed orders via the Internet likely to appeal to only a relatively small number of shoppers.</p>
<p>Even then, they are perhaps more likely to choose to buy their wine, beer or spirits through an online grocery portal, along with the rest of their shopping, than through a specialist outlet. This is because few consumers have the desire to buy in bulk – a requirement of many online sellers in order to keep delivery costs down – no matter whether these bulk orders offer better value for money. </p>
<p>Many people simply do not have the space to stock a case of wine when all they really want is a few bottles. Adding those bottles to a larger grocery order still allows them to benefit from cost savings offered by the grocers, including promotions and special offers, without the problem of finding space (or the cash) for a large order. </p>
<p>Specialist Internet outlets can be successful by focusing on a particular niche within the market as a whole (fine wines, gifts, hard-to-find products, etc.) and with the exception of a few Internet-only companies, such as Virgin Wines or Chateauonline, most of the successful players in this sector are likely to be existing retailers using the Internet as an additional service for their customers.</p>
<p>This offers consumers the guarantee of a name they trust, an important factor when shopping via the Net, but also allows the retailer to generate additional income with the minimum of outlay. Stores can offer all the same services online as they do in person – advice on what to buy, a wide range of products – as well as some that are more tailored to the Net – ordering services, Web-only promotions – and can keep their costs down by arranging delivery from local stores or collection by the shopper at their convenience. </p>
<p>With other factors such as Internet and PC penetration and the safety of online payments also playing a major role in the acceptance of online alcohol sales, moving beyond niche status, albeit a niche with potential for profit, is likely to take many years. </p>",226242,1,174,2006-03-14 16:21:03,34917,39,2005-05-18 00:00:00,IWArticle
Shaw Wallace draught in Indian beer struggle,Shaw Wallace will launch draught Castle Lager and draught Royal Challenge lager on a growing Indian market.,"<p>Shaw Wallace will launch draught Castle Lager and draught Royal Challenge lager on a growing Indian market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>SABMiller controls Shaw Wallace and these launches are a continuation of the group's effort to take on UB Group's leading position in the Indian market beer. By moving into draught beer, an area dominated by its rival, the move will help Shaw Wallace gain market share by developing the fast growing on-trade.</p>
<h3>Success in a bottle</h3>
<p>Draught beer accounts for less than 3% of the 740 million litres sold in 2004 due to the difficulty of keeping it in a drinkable condition and the unpopularity of drinking in on-trade establishments. UB Group's dominates bottled beer sales with its leading Kingfisher brand and the company tends to focus on the major cities, especially Bangalore.</p>
<p>Only 22% of beer drunk was in the on-trade in 2004. The main limiting factor being the huge expense, the high beer taxes combined with the extra on-trade mark-ups, making it inaccessible to most Indians. Many Indians also see drinking in public as socially unacceptable. Although, on-trade sales are expected to grow faster in the medium term at 55%, compared to 45% overall. Pub and bar culture will become more popular as more ex-pats return from abroad bringing new attitudes to drinking and higher disposable income.</p>
<h3>The pull of the north </h3>
<p>Shaw Wallace has chosen ideal markets for the initial launch its draught variants as draught beer is particularly popular in Bangalore and there are many on-trade establishments in Mumbai.

Thai tax reform to help foreign beer brands?,"The Thai government could restructure alcohol excise duties, changing to a tax on alcohol content rather than on manufacturer prices.","<p>The Thai government could restructure alcohol excise duties, changing to a tax on alcohol content rather than on manufacturer prices.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>If the Thai government changed alcohol excise duties to one based on alcohol content, premium foreign brands such as Heineken and Asahi and local brands such as Leo could see rapid growth at the expense of leading local brands. </p>
<h3>Economy power </h3>
<p>Thai beer sales are dominated by brands with high levels of alcohol. The top three best selling brands all have alcohol content of over 6% abv and accounted for just over 80% of the 1.4 billion litres sold in 2003. The top two Beer Thai's Chang and Boon Rawd Brewery's (Boon Rawd) Thai Beer had over 56% and 12% shares respectively are economy brands. This meant in 2004, economy brands accounted for nearly 80% of the 1.6 billion litres sold compared to premium share of nearly 9%.</p>
<p>Despite alcoholic drinks being heavily taxed, due to health concerns, the current system allows products with a high alcoholic content to be sold cheaply if it has a low manufacturing price. Beer Thai's leading Chang brand costs around Bt19.5 (US$0.48) for a 330ml can, while Heineken's namesake brand costs Bt34 (US$0.83) for a same sized pack despite the latter having an abv content around 1% less than Chang.</p>
<p>The change will differentiate between premium lower alcohol products and strong economy brands, allowing some Thai consumers to trade up to more premium products such as Heineken and Carlsberg and allow premium consumers to trade up to super-premium products such as Budweiser. The legislation will be of special benefit to the economy brands with lower abv such as Boon Rawd's Leo brand and reduce the differential between Beer Thai's Chang and Boon Rawd's standard Singhua brands.</p>
<p>Despite reducing the pricing difference, it will do little to help Boon Rawd reduce Beer Thai's dominance of beer. This is due to Beer Thai's dominance of distribution and it will offer a lower abv product to challenge cheap economy brands such as Leo.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-15 12:22:45,35440,39,2005-06-06 00:00:00,IWArticle
US sees cheaper beer make less cents,SABMiller has announced that it plans to match Anheuser-Busch's price discounts.,"<p>SABMiller has announced that it plans to match Anheuser-Busch's price discounts.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The announcement, along with the Molson Coors signal of an intention to join in, will lead to an extensive price war in 2005 that may improve volume sales in the short term but in the long run will only harm the brewers. US consumers are becoming increasingly more eclectic and premium in their tastes and are moving away from beer, which no amount of discounting will stop.</p>
<h3>More variety </h3>
<p>Spirits and wine drove growth in US alcoholic drinks in 2004, which both increased by 4%, while beer saw static sales. Consumers continued to switch to these drinks, as they increasingly perceive these products as being more fashionable to drink than staid, traditional beers. Most consumers now drink beer less often as they develop a repertoire of drinks for different occasions. </p>
<p>Discounts tend only to reward existing consumers. It will cause beer drinkers to buy more in bulk in the short term when on promotion and stock up and not purchase as often. If the discounting continues, consumers will increasingly see beer as a low value, commodity product and expect to buy beer only on discount. It will also lessen brand loyalty with increasing numbers of consumers purchasing the brand on promotion rather than the brand for which they feel some affinity.</p>
<p>As volume sales of beer are likely to decline by over 3% until 2009, the only way volume sales will be boosted in the short term, will be if it is a hot summer, when consumers will drink more to quench their thirst. All three brewers will miss bigger profits, as they will be funding discounts. </p>
<h3>Stay premium </h3>
<p>Brewers should focus on producing more premium products such as Anheuser-Busch's B(E) and enhance their main brands' images to portray them as more premium products and maintain profits. They should look to fast growing markets in Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe to boost volume sales. </p>",436,1,156,2006-11-16 10:44:40,36010,39,2005-06-17 00:00:00,IWArticle
Mexican frontier for beer in Latin America,"As the domination of Latin American beer markets by local players prepares for a slowdown, foreign investment in the region prepares to hot up.

Following an investigation into anti-competitive practices in Mexico and the sale of Interbrew's stake in FEMSA, global beer analyst Natasha Cazin at Euromonitor explores the potential for new entrants in the country's highly profitable beer market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The attention of the global beer industry has shifted to Latin America over the past twelve months. All eyes were on Belgium-based Interbrew in August 2004 as it merged with AmBev of Brazil, to create InBev, forming the world's largest brewing company. And there was little surprise when InBev announced its intention to plough US$20 million into El Salvador's beer market earlier in 2005. Currently, industry followers are closely surveying the fight for control of Colombian Bavaria's core beverage business.</p>
<p>A takeover of Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, however, will not signify the last opportunity for international players to gain large-scale access to the Latin American beer market, a crucial growth area for the beer industry. New research from Euromonitor International suggests that neighbouring Mexico could be the next mass-market route to the region.</p>
<h2>Tight duopoly in Mexico</h2>
<p>In Mexico, FEMSA and Grupo Modelo enjoy a duopoly in the beer market. Grupo Modelo holds the leading position there, with a 55.7% market share in 2003, while FEMSA follows closely behind with a 43.4% share, according to Euromonitor. Almost all of the negligible remaining volumes are divided between Heineken and SABMiller, each with a 0.3% share in 2003.</p>
<p>Until recently, the duopolistic character of the Mexican beer market seemed unlikely to change dramatically, with consumer conservatism compounded by the brewers' strategy of owning retail outlets and forging exclusive arrangements with independent beer sellers such as traditional food stores, restaurants and stadiums. </p>
<p></p>
<p>With the standard lager segment divided between Modelo and FEMSA, the main opportunity for international players to make their presence felt has been in the imported premium lager segment. However, imported beer is mainly sold in supermarkets, which given their relatively small share in beer distribution continues to limit growth.</p>
<p>In addition, legal and logistical barriers have effectively prevented importers gaining much of a foothold. There have been reports of an inordinate number of ""routine"" checks on lorries transporting US beer over the border which have delayed delivery of the cases, and “mom and pop” stores incurring higher tax obligations if they sell imported beer brands.</p>
<h2>Duopoly to break by 2010</h2>
<p>However, due to two key external factors, Euromonitor expects to see the end of what has been described as one the most “hermetic” duopolies in the global beverage landscape by 2010, leaving opportunities for international manufacturers to make their mark in this illustrious market. </p>
<p>Interbrew's sale of its stake in FEMSA, as a consequence of the AmBev deal, is the first major factor that will influence the change in the shape of Mexico's beer landscape. The deal, signed in May 2004, saw Labatt Brewing Company Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Interbrew, selling to FEMSA its 30% interest in FEMSA Cerveza SA de CV (CCM), a subsidiary of FEMSA, for nearly US$1.3 billion in cash. Euromonitor believes that FEMSA's renewed independence leaves it as a highly attractive potential target in the Latin American beer industry.</p>
<p>The other major factor involves August 2004's complaint of alleged anti-competitive practices against the Mexican brewers filed to the Mexican Anti-Trust Commission (CFC) by an international player (deduced to be SABMiller by process of elimination). Although, both Modelo and FEMSA have been under the microscope of Mexico's anti-trust watchdog before, Euromonitor believes current investigations are likely to be significantly more complex, with an influx of further accusations expected from other international players willing to carve out a share in this profitable market. </p>
<h2>Growth potential attractive to international players</h2>
<p>When the duopoly eventually breaks, Euromonitor considers that the Mexican beer market, with a 3.5% share of global beer volumes, offers one of the best opportunities for international players to flourish. China is the largest beer market in the world, and Mexico is approximately 20% the size of that market. </p>
<p>Mexico was the third fastest growing market in Latin America over the 1997-2004 period, 10 percentage points above total regional growth which reached 5.2%. Mexican per capita consumption stands at 50 litres, 37% lower than the US. Although this is high, compared to other Latin American countries – consumption in Argentina and Colombia stands at 38 and 34 litres per head, respectively – other factors such as a young and growing population, low beer prices and favourable weather implies that there is important growth potential in consumption levels in Mexico. </p>

<h2>Mexico not priority for InBev</h2>
<p>Should the Mexican Anti-Trust Commission eventually decide to force the sale of a number of FEMSA's and Modelo's assets, there are plenty of potential bidders that would like to take a piece of either entities. </p>
<p>InBev is, theoretically, a potential predator. The brewing giant, recently formed from the merger between Belgian brewer Interbrew and AmBev of Brazil, has repeatedly expressed its interest in the highly profitable Mexican market. </p>
<p>Euromonitor does not rule out the possibility of it entering the market through a joint venture distribution agreement with a Mexican Pepsi bottler, as it has done in Peru, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Central America. An exploratory joint venture would enable InBev access to a much wider network of points of sale beyond a single supermarket chain.</p>
<p>However, given its already strong position in the region – InBev's market share in Latin America stood at nearly 30% in 2003 - the next priority for InBev is more likely to be to extend its position in the developed markets of Western Europe and North America. Euromonitor expects Spain's number one beer producer, Grupo Mahou – San Miguel, to become available for sale in 2005 and the 8.6 million hectolitre brewery would certainly be of interest to Inbev. </p>
<p>While there may be a fit with a Mexican brewer, a deal also seems unlikely as InBev is sure to be faced with numerous anti-trust problems, given its strong foothold in the Brazilian market through its existing operation, AmBev. </p>
<h2>Pressure on for Heineken</h2>
<p>With SABMiller's turnaround at Miller and Interbrew's successful execution of the AmBev deal, the pressure is on for Heineken to extend its position in the developing world in order to gain a secure foothold in the global beer market. At present, Mexico could be the ideal opportunity for Heineken, and following its recent success in securing a 3-year licensing deal for FEMSA's brands Heineken is tipped to be a clear favourite.</p>
<p>Taking on some of FEMSA's assets, for example, would not only offer it some interesting synergies, but also the competitive benefits of consolidation in Latin America. Heineken's presence in the Latin American market is currently modest, following the sales of its stake in Quilmes and the disappointing return from its stake in Kaiser. The Dutch brewer ranked in only 12th place in the region in 2003, with a meager 0.8% of total volume sales.</p>
<h2>SABMiller would benefit</h2>
<p>Currently with a minimal presence in Latin America, SABMiller has also been earmarked to focus on the Mexican market for investment over the next five years. In addition to enhancing the South African brewer's representation in the region, which stood at 0.9% in 2003, an alliance with either FEMSA or Modelo would fill substantial gaps in SABMiller's beer portfolios, giving the brewer several key Latin American standard lager brands, such as Tecate, Sol and Corona Extra, which they are currently missing. </p>
<p>While there may be a fit with a Mexican brewer, in order to maintain an appropriate balance between emerging and developed markets – unlike Heineken, SABMiller has already established a strong position in the emerging markets following its recent acquisitions in China and Asia – the brewer would be well advised to focus on the Western markets for its next investment.</p>
<h2>More opportunities in Latin America</h2>
<p>So in Euromonitor's view, Latin American consolidation will continue to accelerate over the next five years and Mexico is where the next signs of action are to take place. Anti-competitive investigations are bound to make life harder for the region's notorious monopolies if regulatory changes in Mexico eventually come into effect. And it will be no revelation to see the likes of Backus y Johnston in Peru or Empresas Polar in Ecuador also in the offing. Lack of capital is also a major barrier to growth and certainly one that leaves these Latin American brewers more open to acquisition by an international company.</p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Foster's Group's expansion is an attempt is also to become less reliant on wine sales. The agreement is part of the increased activity of leading brewers to get a share of this potentially huge market. </p>
<h3>Adding balance </h3>
<p>Foster's Group has been looking to expand its beer sales, as a way of shielding itself from the current capricious nature of grape harvest dependent, wine prices. This has become a more pressing issue after the acquisition of Southcorp. Beer offers a far more predictable source of income. The company has signed distribution agreements in both Russia and Turkey for its Foster's brand.</p>
<h3>Joining the stampede </h3>
<p>Since the beginning of 2005, there has been a lot of activity by international brewers in India. Scottish & Newcastle and SABMiller have increased their stakes in UB Group and Shaw Wallace respectively. SABMiller also recently announcement that it was to spend US$125 million over the next five years on marketing and improving production facilities in India. In addition, Carlsberg is in early stages of setting up a production and distribution network in the country.</p>
<p>Indian beer sector grew relatively slowly at around 6% in 2004 to 740 million litres. Per capita consumption was very low, at less than a litre a person. Growth is stymied by Indians preference to drink products with a high alcohol content such as spirits, especially Indian whisky and (bootlegged) country liquor, a trend that has been reinforced by the tax and regulatory regimes in the different states.</p>
<h3>Squeezed </h3>
<p>In 2003, Foster's Group only had a 2% share of the sector, with most of its sales in West India. The launch in Delhi will allow it to gain a more national distribution base. It will struggle to increase its national share, as North India is only the third biggest region out of four for beer consumption. It will face stiff competition from its rivals in a sector that will see, for its comparatively low per capita consumption base, moderate growth of 45% in the medium term.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-16 14:22:48,36476,39,2005-06-27 00:00:00,IWArticle
Chinese beers to face healthy decline abroad?,"The South Korean and Japanese governments have raised concerns over Chinese beer containing the carcinogen, formaldehyde.","<p>The South Korean and Japanese governments have raised concerns over Chinese beer containing the carcinogen, formaldehyde.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>While the concerns will have little impact on the South Korean and Japanese beer sectors, if concerns spread to other countries in the region, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, exports could suffer. Tsingtao Brewery, which has looked to expand abroad, will endure any backlash.</p>
<h3>Trouble abroad </h3>
<p>China exported over 140 million litres in 2004, down 7% on the previous year. South Korea and Japan accounted for around 4.4 and 2.8 million litres respectively, which are negligible compared to their respective total beer sales of 1.9 billion and 6.6 billion litres. However, China accounted for over 60% of the beer sold in Hong Kong and around 5% of the 466 million litres sold in Taiwan in 2004. Were the concerns to spread, this would be especially damaging to Tsingtao Brewery which had two of the top 10 best selling brands in Hong Kong and 9% of total sales.</p>
<p>It will also hurt Tsingtao in the countries where it still exports brands to be sold by a local distributors such as; Malaysia and Singapore where the company had built up just under a 1% share in each and potential markets such as Thailand.</p>
<h3>No longer niche to know </h3>
<p>The scare maybe brief and with the vast majority of Chinese beer still sold domestically the impact will be minimal in volume terms. However, should the concerns become more widespread the reputation of Chinese beer will be tarnished and may damage sales in North American and Western European, where Tsingtao has gained a premium image.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-17 11:55:39,36944,39,2005-07-12 00:00:00,IWArticle

Indeed, China has now overtaken the US as the world's largest beer market, with total volume sales increasing by 41% over the review period.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In the mature regional markets of Australasia, North America and Western Europe, as well as parts of Asia-Pacific, brewers have been struggling to achieve volume growth. This is due to a combination of weakened consumer confidence (particularly in the US and Japan) and changing consumption habits, particularly amongst younger consumers, who are increasing opting for alternative drinks, such as FABs, over traditional lagers and dark beers. Most of the major breweries are therefore placing an increased focus on premium beers, making them more visible and more widely available in both retail and on-trade channels.</p>
<h4>Imports on the up</h4>
<p>In the UK, for example, 2003 saw the demise of Heineken Cold Filtered to be replaced by a 5% abv genuinely imported version. Scottish & Newcastle also announced its intention to cease production of several of its economy lager brands, including Hofmeister and Kestral Pilsner, as well as its McEwan’s standard lager and Courage Light standard ale brands, in order to focus on the premium segment of the market.</p>
<p>In the US meanwhile, premium imported lagers such as Corona Extra and Heineken continued to perform strongly in 2003, despite the recent economic downturn.</p>
<h4>Light beers carry weight</h4>
<p>Another underlying trend in the beer market over the 1998/2003 period was the rise of ""light beers"". This tendency was particularly pronounced in the US, where Bud Light was the best-selling beer in 2002, having supplanted its older sibling, Budweiser, in the previous year.</p>
<p>Many US consumers continue to eschew full-calorie beers for their reduced calorie counterparts in an effort to control their waistlines. The latest idea is to reinvent light beers as ""low-carbohydrate"" beers, with Michelob Ultra leading the way.</p>
<p>Another developing trend is the increase in niche and speciality beers. These essentially are the products of microbreweries with the emphasis on the use of natural ingredients and traditional brewing techniques, and the absence of chemicals associated with large-scale production. Amongst speciality brews, wheat beers were one of the fastest growing product types in 2003, albeit from a very small base.</p>
<h4>Consolidation continues apace</h4>
<p>The global brewing industry has been going through a period of unprecedented change in recent years, with a burst of corporate activity in 2003. The acquisitions of BBAG by Heineken, Birra Peroni by SABMiller and Gabriel Sedlmayr Spaten-Franziskaner Bräu KGaA (Spaten) by Interbrew have highlighted the apparent urgency of the leading players to build scale in order to remain competitive.</p>
<p>The most recent shake-up occurred in March 2004 when Interbrew announced that it had agreed to merge with South American brewing giant AmBev. The combined entity will be the largest brewing company in the world by volume, displacing Anheuser-Busch. The merger represents a good geographic fit, as AmBev is very well placed throughout South America and is beginning to position itself in the Caribbean, while Interbrew is strong in European and North American markets - especially in Canada and Mexico - and in Asia.</p>
<p>In terms of brands, Budweiser remains the world’s biggest, followed by Bud Light and Skol. Of these, Bud Light was the only one to gain share in 2002, thanks to its superior brand equity, marketing and wholesaler execution. Indeed, the brand may well overtake Budweiser to become the leading global beer.</p>",530,2,0,2005-10-24 15:15:15,38384,39,2004-06-25 00:00:00,IWArticle
InBev to focus on German beer,InBev should use funds from the sale of Coca-Cola bottler Bremer to buy brewers outside its North West German heartland. ,"<p>InBev should use funds from the sale of Coca-Cola bottler Bremer to buy brewers outside its North West German heartland. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>That is why InBev should use the proceeds of its sales of Coca-Cola bottler Bremer to expand its German presence. The firm should look to buy up small, struggling local brewers rather than try to introduce its existing brands onto the market. German consumers prefer to drink local brews rather than national or international brands. </p>
<h3>Ripe for consolidation</h3>
<p>Germany has a fragmented beer market and is dominated by local brewers. But as beer sales continue to decline, by over 2% in 2004 to 9.3 billion litres, and with no upturn predicted into the mid to longer term, the time is ripe for consolidation.</p>
<h3>Heading south and east</h3>
<p>InBev should look to the south and east for prospective targets. Expanding its presence in the heartland of German brewing, Bavaria, would also be payoff but would be expensive in the short-term, competing head-to-head as it would be, against rival Heineken. InBev should also look at expanding along the borders of its northwest stronghold.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-21 13:02:16,39443,39,2005-09-01 00:00:00,IWArticle
Can Oetker-Gruppe beer to go premium?,"In the shrinking and increasingly commoditised German beer market, industry players should focus on value over volume.","<p>In the shrinking and increasingly commoditised German beer market, industry players should focus on value over volume.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Oetker-Gruppe became the biggest German brewer in 2004 with a 13% volume share, following the acquisition of Brau und Brunnen. The purchase strengthened the company's standard and economy lager ranges but has overshadowed the firm's premium brands, which now account for less than a third of its volume sales. In an increasingly tough market, these high-value brands are key to a brewer's long-term health. An acquisition of a premium company is what is needed and after the sale of its soft drinks brands, Oetker-Gruppe is in the financial position to do just this. Choosing a target should be simple too, with minor brewers accounting for 42% of premium lager sales in Germany there should be no shortage of targets.</p>
<h3>Beer split</h3>
<p>Beer continued to decline by volume last year, by nearly 2% to 9.3 million litres. This downward trend is set to continue into the mid to longer term. The sector is also becoming increasingly polarised between economy and premium lager. Brewers need to organise their portfolios accordingly.</p>
<h3>Premium filling in the gaps</h3>
<p>Oetker-Gruppe already has a good geographic spread of breweries across the country, so unlike its rivals InBev or Heineken, where it buys brands is not the issue. The company needs instead to look for quality brewers with an eye to getting the most recognised premium labels possible.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-21 12:51:54,39495,39,2005-09-01 00:00:00,IWArticle
Darkness rises for New Zealand beer,Lion Nathan is trying to maximise their revenues in a mature market by launching InBev's two premium dark beers Hoegaarden and Leffe.,"<p>Lion Nathan is trying to maximise their revenues in a mature market by launching InBev's two premium dark beers Hoegaarden and Leffe.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Lion Nathan and InBev are both looking to tap into New Zealanders premium and eclectic tastes and improve sales. The 314 million-litre beer sector grew by only 1% in volume terms but by over 5% in value to NZ$2.5 billion (US$1.7 billion) in 2004. Growth was driven in part by a rise in excise duty but primarily by consumers trading up to more premium products. </p>
<h3>Living it up </h3>
<p>Premium lager was the fastest growing beer subsector, albeit from a low base, up 5% to 35 million litres in 2004 and over twice that rate in value terms. Premiumisation also drove dark beer with its 7% value increase over twice the volume gain due to the popularity of premium craft beers such as Monteith's, and Speight's.</p>
<p>Increased disposable income and the development of more upmarket on-trade establishments such as Monteith's, Belgian Beer Cafes and Heineken Concept Bars have driven the premiumisation. These establishments offer consumers a wide selection of beers and a sophisticated drinking environment. This sophistication has spread to the off-trade with many retailers offering over 50 premium brands in each outlet.</p>
<h3>Dark and strong?</h3>
<p>The premiumisation trend is expected to continue in the medium term with premium lager and dark beer expected to grow at around three times the 6% volume increase of beer overall. This growth combined with Lion Nathan's dominance of New Zealand beer will give both brands a very good chance of establishing themselves as niche super premium brands.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-21 14:29:42,39720,39,2005-09-02 00:00:00,IWArticle
Wheat beer thrives through its unique offerings,"The English beer writer Michael Jackson recalls that when he first came across wheat beer in the 1960s only little old ladies in hats drank it.

It is now the sort of fashionable drink that sponsors golf tournaments and is served in the bars of 5-star hotels. ","<p>The English beer writer Michael Jackson recalls that when he first came across wheat beer in the 1960s only little old ladies in hats drank it. Today, the beer's image has moved a remarkable distance from that of a dusty, declining drink consumed solely by pensioners.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>With volume consumption approaching saturation in several developed beer markets, such as the UK, France, Australia and the US, breweries have been focusing on developing wheat beer, in all its different varieties, led by Belgian wit bier and South German hefeweize, as a means to maintaining higher growth margins. It is now the fastest growing beer segment in many countries around the world, up by almost 14% in volumes in the UK in 2003-2004, up by nearly 10% in Italy in the same period, and up by 4% in the US.</p>
<p>Much of the style's modern success is down to the way its offerings, despite being centuries old, have suddenly coincided with the requirements of 21st-century drinkers: it is an easy-to-drink, easily identifiable (being generally cloudy to the point of opaqueness), refreshing beverage, that is low in alcohol.  Because it normally contains live yeast, it also has an undercurrent of health and vitality about it. Marketers have been able to present it as aspirational and exclusive, both modern and traditional at the same time, a beer for people who know about beer but are not beer bores.</p>

<h2>Strategies for success</h2>
<p>The remarkable recovery in sales of wheat beer in mainland Europe in the late 1970s and 1980s was down to the drink's most obvious unique selling point (USP): it looks entirely different from other, mainstream, pure barley-brewed beers, with the wheat content adding proteins that make it almost automatically cloudy, rather than clear and bright. In addition, wheat beers frequently contain suspended yeast in the bottle or cask that adds to the hazy appearance of the drink in the glass. It is clear that it is not a common, ordinary, mass-market beer of the “Helles” (pale lager) or Pilsner type. Much like Guinness (owned by Diageo Plc), with its utterly distinctive black body and white head, wheat beer stands out, and makes its drinkers stand out too. </p>
<p>In the 1980s, a time when the cachet of brand exclusivity was taking off as a concept, young Bavarians picked up on “granny's drink” to show they appreciated something other than the golden lagers drunk by the masses. Sales of wheat beer went skywards, according to figures from the Bayerische Brauerbund, from a low of 3% of the Bavarian beer market by volume in the early 1960s to 2004's 25% figure. </p>
<p>Erdinger Privatbrauerei Weissbräu Werner Brombach GmbH in Germany, saw its production explode from just 40,000 hectolitres per year in 1965 to 900,000 hectolitres in 1987 (according to the company's own figures), a 22-fold increase in 22 years. Erdinger's latest figures show that it brews 1.45 million hectolitres a year, almost 40 times as much as in 2005.</p>
<p>As with Guinness, its distinctiveness means that wheat beer is frequently sold at a premium price, the cost of the cloudy, pale, idiosyncratic drink reinforcing its exclusivity and suggesting the wheat beer consumer can afford something special. In many markets, such as the UK, the US and Australia, it is the beer drinker's equivalent to wearing Oakley sunglasses or Dolce & Gabbana jeans. Wheat beer drinkers are happy when (as they generally do) they pay a premium for their drink. </p>
<p>A similar ""exclusivity by price"" trick has been used very successfully in the UK to market Stella Artois (owned by InBev), an ordinary standard lager in its native Belgium, as a premium beer that is ""reassuringly expensive"". However, unlike Stella, part of the premium positioning of wheat beers frequently includes a restriction on their availability, letting them be seen on sale only in ""style"" bars and the like.</p>
<h2>Appeal widened to non-beer drinkers</h2>
<p>Many wheat beers, particularly the Belgian variety, are lower in alcohol than other ""premium"" beers, which is a bonus at a time when people are being encouraged to watch their alcohol units. Their often sharp, tart taste makes them, to many drinkers, even more refreshing than lagers, at a time when the increasing number of long hot summers makes refreshment a prime marketable quality in a beer. The yeast they contain makes them, to many German drinkers at least, a more ""natural"", healthy drink than standard beers: yeast, after all, is ""good for you"", since pharmacies sell it in tablet form.</p>
<h2>Good partner with food</h2>
<p>They also have a range of flavours not found in other beers: the special yeast used in traditional South German wheat beers (South German rather than just Bavarian, because the style is also found in neighbouring Baden-Wurtemburg and in other areas of the country) gives the product a hint of banana, clove and bubblegum. In other countries, Belgian and Dutch wheat beer brewers add spices and other flavourings. These extra tastes, and the lack of hop bitterness, make wheat beers good partners with food, especially fish dishes and white meats, such as chicken and pork. The growing trend towards matching beer, rather than wine, with food thus puts wheat beers in the front line of a developing marketing opportunity for brewers and retailers, beer and dining.</p>
<p>Pushing wheat beer as a good match with food is a strategy being actively pursued by InBev, the company formed from the merger of Interbrew of Belgium with Ambev of Brazil in 2004, and now the largest brewer in the world by volume. Interbrew took over ownership of the Belgian wheat beer brand Hoegaarden in the 1980s, and, in 2003 it acquired the Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu KGaA brewery in Bavaria. The Belgian company admitted to the European Commission inquiry into the takeover that the rationale of the transaction was to complement its portfolio with speciality wheat beers, notably the Franziskaner brand, which was “the most important beer type made by Spaten”. </p>
<p>InBev's 2-pronged attack on the world's beer market is made up of mainstream beers, the most important being Stella Artois, and speciality beers (ie brands to add value in mature beer markets), with Hoegaarden being the biggest of these. InBev says it sees Hoegaarden as one of its ""global"" brands, and Franziskaner as a high-quality speciality beverage for ""educated"" beer drinkers. Although these are both wheat beers, according to the company, their product profiles are very different; the latter is brewed according to the German Purity Law, whilst the Belgian beer is brewed with special ingredients such as orange peel and coriander. </p>
<p>InBev intends to push its beer brands as companions to food as it seeks to expand their sales: “Hoegaarden, for example, is a beer that matches perfectly with dishes with a slightly acidic accent,” Inbev's company spokesperson, Marianne Amssoms  says. “It pairs very well with fresh seafood such as oysters, lobster and so on. Hoegaarden also pairs perfectly with Asian-style food, which is sometimes slightly sweet and sour.” Brewers of other minority specialist styles, such as cask bitter from Britain or Alt from the Dusseldorf region of Germany, can also market their products as good companions on the dining table, but wheat beers' unique flavours give them an advantage over their rivals when it comes to food matching. </p>
<p>As part of the push to appeal to diners, Hoegaarden is now marketed in larger-sized bottles, up to 750ml, in the off-trade channel in markets such as the UK, pitching it directly against bottles of wine as a shareable drinking experience for meal times. This is a strategy other brewers are beginning to follow with beers they too would like to see drunk at mealtimes, such as Grolsch, the Dutch lager also now available in 75cl bottles.</p>
<h2>The attraction of heritage</h2>
<p>Wheat beer brewers have also been able to use the beer's historic heritage as a selling point. The fact that it is an ancient, old-established style gives it a credibility in the specialist beer market, where authenticity is often a virtue, that, for example, very few lagers, with the exception of the SABMiller-owned Pilsner Urquell, the ""original"" pale lager, first brewed in Bohemia in 1842, can match. It is this search for heritage that led InBev to revive Artois Bock in 2005, almost two decades after it was last brewed, to be marketed as a beer with history behind it, which the company hopes will appeal to mainstream Stella drinkers looking to experiment in the specialist market. </p>
<p>Stressing heritage is a marketing strategy other brewers of specialist styles, such as cask ale in Britain, and Alt or Kolsch from Cologne, can pick up on, and if InBev is right in its prediction of a 5-fold rise in sales of speciality beer over the next 10 years bringing new consumers into the beer category, it is likely to be an increasingly common strategy as companies seek an edge over rivals.</p>
<h2>Good worldwide opportunities for wheat beer</h2>
<p>While Scottish & Newcastle Plc has no plans to sell Kronenbourg Blanc anywhere outside the UK, not even in France where it is brewed, Euromonitor believes there is still a global market for its beers. </p>
<p>Erdinger, which claims to be the world's most popular wheat beer, produces 1.45 million hectolitres a year, on sale in 70 countries, and with 20% of the German wheat beer market. In 2003 it introduced a 33cl ""long-neck"" bottle for markets such as the US, where drinking from the bottle is almost obligatory. The company has also chosen Franz Beckenbauer, the World Cup-winning German footballer, as its ""brand ambassador"", suitably since he is even known in the US, where he once played for the New York Cosmos. As a Bavarian, he insists that wheat beer is not an alcoholic drink, ""but part of ones basic diet"". </p>
<p>Erdinger's promotions include a golf championship in Italy, skiing events in Switzerland, and the sponsorship of entrants in the Hawaii Ironman triathlon via its Erdinger Non-Alcoholic brand. All of these are attempts to associate wheat beer with sport and fitness, an opportunity open to few other beers. The beer is also available in the Burj al Arab hotel in Dubai, arguably one of the most prestigious, luxurious and expensive hotels in the world. </p>
<p>Its Munich rival Paulaner Brauerei GmbH & Co KG, number one in the German wheat beer market ahead of Erdinger, is another sponsor of golf tournaments, partnering the BMW International Open, and thus pitching itself firmly at golf-loving, BMW-driving over-30-year-olds. In the US, however, it has been squarely repositioning itself as a beer for the ""younger adult"" (ie 2-25-year-olds), with in-bar gimmicks such as illuminated lemons – a slice of lemon being, for some drinkers (though very few Bavarians), an essential part of the wheat beer experience. Paulaner also owns the Hacker-Pschorr brand, and itself is 50% owned by Heineken. Hacker-Pschorr is about to launch a new brand on the Bavarian market, Sternweisse, or starwhite, an amber-coloured 5.5% ABV wheat beer in a bottle with a Grolsch-style ceramic stopper.</p>
<p>Alongside Erdinger, Paulaner and Spaten-Franziskaner, the other big name in Bavarian-style wheat beer is Weissbierbrauerei Schneider & Sohn GmbH. The company's original Munich brewery was destroyed in World War II, and it now brews a highly regarded, slightly darker than usual wheat beer in Kelheim, Bavaria. </p>
<p>Spokeswoman Susanne Hecht says the company thinks there are good worldwide opportunities, even for a comparatively small concern like Schneider: ""In more and more countries, we see people becoming more interested in speciality beers, willing to spend money on a good beer. In the UK, the US and also Scandinavia, we see the speciality beer market growing. In Latin America and Eastern Europe, there is certainly a clientele that is able to afford an expensive speciality wheat beer, and the number of these people is growing too. China and the Far East are markets with a good future. However, you have to be careful to find the right licensing partner.""</p>
<p>Wheat beer is expected to grow in most Western beer markets over the 2004-2009 forecast period, according to Euromonitor, with estimates of 25% volume growth in the UK to 2009, nearly 27% growth in Italy, 11% in Spain, 18% in Denmark and even 5% in Belgium, while Germany's sales are expected to rise another 15% to more than 860 million hectolitres by 2009.</p>
<p>Wheat beer, Hecht says, ""is not just a fashion, but a long-term trend, especially in the international market, which is growing faster than the German national market."" To keep growth going, she says, ""we are convinced that it is important to teach people about speciality beers. People should not regard beer as inferior to wine. Tastings, beer menus, recommendations with food – all of these are ways to educate people."" </p>

<h2>New rivals to old brands</h2>
<p>A testament to the competence of wheat beer brewers is the fact that those with no heritage in the sector are looking for a wheat beer brand for their portfolios, meaning new names, without the centuries-old heritage of, say, Bavarian wheat beer, are challenging for market share. </p>
<p>Wheat beer brewers have other weapons than a reliance on premium positioning and pricing. They have advantages over rival types of beer that are linked to their taste rather than just their appearance, and help them appeal to non-beer drinkers and infrequent beer drinkers. They are generally less hoppy than most lagers and British ales, with half the bitterness units or less found in many mainstream lager brands, which widens their appeal among those who are normally reluctant consumers of beer. </p>
<p>Heineken NV has the Dutch wheat beer Wieckse Witte, though it has yet to do much with it. In the US, most of the country's “boutique” brewers produce at least one wheat beer in either Belgian or German styles, or both, while Adolph Coors Co has a Belgian-type wheat beer called Blue Moon. Coors has also been experimenting with selling the Korenwolf wheat beer from the Dutch independent brewer Gulpen in the UK (the link is that Gulpen is part owned by Grolsch, whose lager Coors brews under licence in Burton upon Trent). </p>
<p>Also in the UK, Scottish & Newcastle introduced Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc in 2005, a 5% ABV draught “white” beer in a Belgian style, brewed in France specially for the British market and served at a cold three degrees centigrade, as a direct competitor against Hoegaarden. Company spokesman David Jones said drinkers were looking for ""special experiences"", but ""they are reluctant to trial niche brands. Blanc has the 'big brand' endorsement of Kronenbourg, giving consumers the confidence to try it.""</p>
<p>According to Jones, research ""showed us that Blanc appeals to a wider audience than traditional wheat beers”, with the primary target market being ABC1 22-44-year-old men and women. Blanc commands a price premium of 25-30% above premium draught lagers, but despite being more expensive, 98% of the outlets that took the beer at its launch continue to stock it, with sales up 20% a few months after its launch and customers commenting that it was ""more drinkable than beer in general"", a comment that probably applies to most wheat beers. Scottish & Newcastle is now launching Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc in 33cl bottles in the UK off-trade channel, again as a competitor to Hoegaarden.</p>
<p>In Russia, Baltika also introduced No 8 unfiltered wheat beer in 2001. By 2004, the beer was being exported to 17 countries, with export volumes of 15,800 hectolitres in 2003. Next door in the Ukraine, in October 2003, Ridna Marka Corporation introduced Pshenychne Etalon, a Bavarian-style wheat beer, which almost immediately won a gold medal in the World Beer Cup, while, one month later, Slavutych brought out its own Slavutych Weiss wheat beer. </p>
<p>Local brewers, as well as calling upon local loyalties, can also produce local specialities that international wheat beer brewers cannot match: Kona Brewing Company in Hawaii, for example, makes Lilikoi wheat beer, flavoured with locally grown fresh lilikoi, or yellow passion fruit. </p>

<p>Seven out of the 10 countries expected to see the largest per capita growth by 2009 were Eastern European. Ukraine will comfortably see the largest increase up 19 litres per person, followed by Russia with less than 13 litres per person. Beer is becoming more popular as Eastern European consumers broaden their drinks repertoire away from traditional spirits, most notably vodka. The same also applies to the one Asia Pacific country that made the top 10, third ranked Thailand.</p>

Belarus: The new frontier for beer in Eastern Europe,"After years of stagnation, the Belarussian beer market could be ripe for rapid growth and a prime target for international brewers.","<p>After years of stagnation, the Belarussian beer market could be ripe for rapid growth and a prime target for international brewers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Belarussian beer came back after years of disappointing sales to achieve growth of around 10% in 2004, to 240 million litres. The sector has benefited from the government's re-opening of the market in that year combined with greater investment in domestic production. The country has huge potential, having far from reached maturity, with per capita consumption of just 24 litres in 2004 compared to 58 litres and 36 litres for its neighbours Russia and the Ukraine respectivley.</p>
<h3>Rich pickings await </h3>
<p>Unlike Russia and the Ukraine, Belarus has a history of beer consumption making it even more of a hot-bed for potential growth. Sales could as much as double by the end of the decade to over 500 million litres, rivalling Russia's current consumption levels. This not only makes Belarus a big potential export market for international brewers, but also a potential hunting ground for take-over targets. The country's top brewers, Dednovo and Krynitsa, would be tempt a number of multinationals, including BBH, InBev and Heineken, all of whom have strong shares in neighbouring Russia and the Ukraine. </p>",436,1,156,2006-11-22 13:58:41,40970,39,2005-09-20 00:00:00,IWArticle

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Imported premium lager grew by 11% in 2004 to reach 224 million litres or just under 10% of all Canadian beer sales. Strong economic growth has increased disposable income and its allowing consumers to trade up. Mexican beer was the most popular type of imported beer in 2004 accounting for 46 million litres or 20% of total imports. Most of the Mexican imports were of Corona Beer, the most popular imported premium lager in Canada, distributed by Molsons. The agreement between FEMSA and Sleeman Breweries will allow the Canadian brewer's to import and sell FEMSA's Sol and Dos Equis brands from the start of 2006.</p>
<h3>Double benefits </h3>
<p>The agreement is good for both parties. FEMSA will gain a distributor who will prioritise its brands more. Sol has been distributed by the country's second biggest brewer, Labatts, who preferred to focus on its own InBev brands, Beck's and Stella Artois, rather than Sol. The Mexican brand has seen its share of imported premium lager more than halve to just over 1% since 2000.</p>
<p>Sleeman Breweries, which is a distant third behind the big two brewers, Labatts and Molson, will benefit from the popularity of Mexican beer and two strong brands. The additions to its existing range of Grolsch and Sapporo lagers will give it a better balance and the opportunity to carry on building its share of the market. Imported premium lager is expected to grow by 74% by end of the decade compared to less than 10% for the sector as a whole.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-23 11:23:02,41221,39,2005-10-04 00:00:00,IWArticle
A premium niche for seasonal beer,Anheuser-Busch's first launch of a seasonal beer in the US is an attempt to maximise its volume and value sales in a shrinking sector.,"<p>Anheuser-Busch's first launch of a seasonal beer in the US is an attempt to maximise its volume and value sales in a shrinking sector.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Anheuser-Busch's launch of Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale is the first of a series of seasonal beer launches in an attempt to capitalise on growing popularity of 'craft' beer. The products are popular, as consumers are increasingly looking for more taste and variety of flavours in their alcoholic drinks, including beer.</p>
<h3>Growth all round </h3>
<p>In 2004, according to the Brewers Association, 'craft' beers grew by over 7% to 773 million litres, in a sector that grew by less than 1% to 23.8 billion litres. The trend continued in the first half of 2005 with craft beer sales up another 7% as overall beer sales declined.</p>
<p>Craft beer is also helping drive value sales, as many are premium products with a sophisticated image favoured by the American market. This popularity has led to annual per capita spending on beer to rise by US$9 to US$257 in 2004, while per capita volume sales remained static.</p>
<h3>Niche appeal </h3>
<p>The series of launches will impact more on value rather than volume sales due to the seasonal ales' premium nature. Craft beers, especially flavoured ones such as Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale are likely to remain niche items. Flavoured beers failed previously when brewers attempted to launch them at around the turn of the century. It is unlikely, despite the more cosmopolitan tastes of some consumers, that this has changed enough for the products to see large volume growth. In addition, sales could be hit as some traditional craft beer drinks may not take to the products simply because it is made by a brewing giant rather than a small local producer.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-28 11:09:28,41553,39,2005-10-07 00:00:00,IWArticle
Corporate Insight: Carlsberg gain control of Laos beer,The acquisition further strengthens Carlsberg's grip on the South East Asian markets. ,"<p>The acquisition further strengthens Carlsberg's grip on the South East Asian markets. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The acquisition of the 25% share of Lao Brewery from Chang is part of the settlement of the dispute between the two former partners. It gives Carlsberg 50% of the country's leading brewer, which controls 99% of the 105 million litre sector. The move is the latest in a series of deals that provides a leading position in this under developed area. </p>
<h3>Big player </h3>
<p>Carlsberg has been busy in the region. So far in 2005; the company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with leading Vietnamese brewer Habeco in May giving it over 20% of the country's beer sector, in September Carlsberg purchased of a 50% stake in Cambodia's Cambrew brewery, which had 45% of the 83 million litre sector. This makes Carlsberg either the first or the second ranked company in many countries in the region, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and now Cambodia. </p>
<h3>Big potential </h3>
<p>Carlsberg's leading position in these four countries with a population totalling 131 million people and low per capita consumption, gives it huge potential for volume growth and increasing its less than 1% share of Asia Pacific. The two countries with the smallest population, Singapore and Laos have the highest levels of consumption of only around 20 litres a person.</p>",436,1,156,2006-11-28 10:07:16,42334,39,2005-10-27 00:00:00,IWArticle

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>An antiquated image, coupled with intensified competition from healthier, trendier alcoholic beverages contributed to the continued decline in Germany's beer sales this year. Manufacturers are trying to revive sales but consumers are still failing to buy into beer, which saw volume sales decline by 2% in 2005. Continued volume growth in Brazil sees the Latin American step up to the bar to become the world's third largest market for beer.</p>
<h3>Healthy living bad news for beer</h3>
<p>A growing demand for healthy drinks is proving to be the death of beer in Germany. Earlier this year, Dr. Oetker, the country's largest beer producer, was forced to close two of its leading breweries due to healthy living trends that has seen mineral water sales overtake beer consumption in the country. The health and wellness trend also helped grow volume sales of wine, which has been successfully marketed on the strength of its health benefits.</p>
<p>The introduction of Germany's packaging deposit law has further depressed demand, with some stores no longer stocking canned beer to avoid getting caught up in the regulations. (Wine and spirits are exempt from the legsilation.) Brewers, such as Holsten, are trying to get around the problem by investing more in glass and plastic packaging but such a strategy is not a cure-all for the industry. Economy brands in particular will suffer, compromising their low-priced position in order to upgrade to costlier packaging materials.</p>
<h3>Growth on tap for Brazil</h3>
<p>As sales fell in Germany, Brazil's beer sector enjoyed growth of some 7% in 2005, selling around 9.3 billion litres. Sales are expected to escalate by a further 25% by the end of the decade. Consumption has been boosted by improved economic conditions and heavy promotional investment by the large local brewers.</p>
<h3>Russian tipple to topple the tables</h3>
<p>Looking forward, Russia is expected to overtake both Brazil and Germany by 2010 to take third place in the beer consumption table. Beer is expected to enjoy growth of over 50% over the next five years in Russia as consumption in rural regions plays catch up with cities such as Moscow, where per capita consumption of beer is some 20-30 litres a year ahead.</p>",405,1,154,2005-12-21 15:55:41,43507,39,2005-12-21 00:00:00,IWArticle
Beer goggles: Alcohol is the latest cosmetics craze,The term 'beauty bar' is taking on a whole new meaning as cosmetics firms experiment with a cocktail of alcohol-infused products.,"<p>The term 'beauty bar' is taking on a whole new meaning as cosmetics firms experiment with a cocktail of alcohol-infused products.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Labels on today's beauty brands are reading more like menus than scientific formulations as fruits and vegetables make their way out of the fridge and into the bathroom cabinet. Now some industry innovators have taken this trend a step further, uncorking the potential for cosmetics and toiletries based on spirits, wine and even beer.</p>
<h3>A recipe for success </h3>
<p>Marketing personal care products on their food or drink content allows them to cash in on the growing preference for natural ingredients. It also links brands directly to the image and perceptions associated with the particular comestible they contain. The health and wellness trend has led to better consumer awareness of the nutritional benefits associated with particular foods. Cosmetics firms looking to position their products as extra nourishing could use broccoli, mangosteen, soybean or other so-called 'super' antioxidants to achieve this. Noni juice is not only a current healthfood fad but also lends an image of the exotic, something which Tahitian Noni's TePoemä facial care and Moéa body and hair care ranges play on. The Body Shop emphasised strawberries as an aphrodisiac when it launched its latest strawberry body care range in time for Valentine's Day 2006.</p>
<p>Using branded food or drinks as ingredients in beauty products aligns the images of the two even more closely. Keen to attract a younger demographic, Coty joined forces with confectionery firm Chupa Chups to create the Love Trap and I Love Me teen fragrance lines. L'Oréal partnered with packaged food giant Nestlé to create a more convincing oral skin care supplement, Inneov.</p>
<h3>Now alcohol's on the menu </h3>
<p>French beauty house Caudalie bases its entire philosophy on the anti-ageing properties of grapes. Its latest range of treatments combines wine extracts with other minerals and oligo-elements to provide a soothing spa experience that claims to turn the clock back on older skin. Cosmetics makers across France, the US and South Africa have been experimenting with wine-based formulations for over a decade.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are beginning to experiment with other types of alcohol as well. L'Artisan Parfumeur has launched Absolument Abinthe in the UK; ""an uplifting, tangy blend"" based on the potent green spirit. The Czech Republic's Chodovar brewery has opened with world's first beer spa, with beer baths, massages, wraps, and a take-home cosmetics line. Lush's Cynthia Sylvia Stout hair care brand uses beer to improve its shine-boosting properties and also contains a splash of cognac oil to enhance its smell.</p>
<h3>Blending up new cocktails </h3>
<p>Cosmetics majors could get even more inventive with the types of alcohol they use. Pink champagne could be a draw for women-specific anti-agers, for example. Or a leading cognac or brandy label, such as Hennessy, could be used to perfume a fragrance for young males. Cognac, brandy and whisk(e)y, formerly seen as the preferred tipple of old men, have become trendy among the younger set, particularly those identifying with the bling hip-hop culture. Alcoholic drinks associated with a particular country or culture, such as Russian vodka, Irish whiskey and Jamaican rum, could be used in cosmetics intended for those markets. They could also be used to further propel the already dynamic ethnic cosmetics trend, with Japanese saki, for example, used in beauty brands specifically intended for Japanese skin or hair.</p>",331,1,155,2006-03-29 17:23:28,45595,39,2006-03-29 00:00:00,IWArticle

<h3>Health and wellness extends to beer </h3>
<p>One major trend in traditional mature beer markets, predominantly in Western Europe, North America and Australasia, is a growing consumer concern about the health effects of alcohol consumption. With some inroads already made with light beer, Euromonitor International expects brewers to start to focus more on lower alcohol variants in the year 2006. In Spain, for example, sales of non-/low-alcohol beer grew significantly in 2005, up by 8% in volume terms. The market is set to rise a further 8% in 2006, led by Heineken's Buckler brand. This success is mainly due to demand from older consumers, who for reasons of health or because they are drivers are choosing non/low alcohol beer. Low alcohol beer would have the added advantage of circumventing high tax rates in countries like Ireland, where on-trade prices are encouraging off-trade sales.</p>
<p>In Japan, leading domestic players such as Sapporo, Asahi and Kirin, have diversified into functional beers, such as Namashibori Fiber by Sapporo – a happoshu beer with a high fibre content to promote digestion for example. Looking to the future, Euromonitor expects that beers which are tailored to a person's allergies or ailments will be increasingly commonplace on the shelf alongside standard offerings. In the short term, however, this trend is unlikely to extend beyond Japan, the pioneer of functional foods. In Europe, for example, beer fails to meet a range of EU criteria for a 'healthy' product, preventing brewers from making specific health claims. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International also expects beer targeting diabetics to make an appearance in more countries in 2006, as the number of diabetics is predicted to swell in coming years. This trend has already manifested itself in Germany, where Flensburger Brauerei Emil Peterson launched Flensburger Malz in 2003. Other brewers, such as Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas in Finland, have launched beer brands, Laitilan Kukko Pils and Dark Kukko, which claim a gluten free content, rendering them suitable for consumers suffering from Coeliac disease. Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas is starting to export the product to European market in 2006 due to heavy demand.</p>
<h3>Beer for every occasion</h3>
<p>Beer and food is another area where Euromonitor International expects brewers and their marketers to be making increasing efforts in 2006.  Pushing wheat beer as a good match with food is a strategy already being actively pursued by wheat beer producers such as InBev, owner of wheat beer brands Hoegaarden and Spaten. As part of the push to appeal to diners, Hoegaarden is now marketed in larger-sized bottles, up to 750ml, in the off-trade channel in markets such as the UK, pitching it directly against bottles of wine as a shareable drinking experience for meal times. This is a strategy other brewers are beginning to follow with beers they too would like to see drunk at mealtimes, such as Grolsch, the Dutch lager also now available in 75cl bottles.</p>
<p>Brewers of other minority specialist styles, such as cask bitter from Britain or Alt from the Dusseldorf region of Germany, have also marketed their products as good companions on the dining table, but wheat beers' unique flavours gives it an advantage over their rivals when it comes to food matching.</p>
<p>In 2006, Euromonitor International predict that retailers, pubs and restaurants will be highlighting different beers with corresponding food, for example, Moroccan beer alongside Cous Cous and Japanese beers with Sushi. However, this concept is unlikely to spread beyond major European markets, where specialist, handcrafted beers are more readily available.</p>
<h3>Country forecasts</h3>
<p>China is expected to reinforce its position as the world's largest market by volume in 2006, accounting for around 20% of total sales.  Beer sales in China are expected to grow by around 6%, in value and volume terms over the 2005/06 period. However, with China already singled out as the major growth market of the future, the increasingly consolidated brewing companies are honing in on any other opportunities. </p>
<p>While Euromonitor International does not expect to see another China appearing on our radar in 2006 – as the markets being forecast for strong growth are much smaller in size –India has been highlighted as a very important market to be taking very seriously in the long term.</p>
<p>With a population of over 1 billion people, and extremely low per capita consumption levels compared to most other countries (0.8 litres projected in 2006), India offers tremendous growth potential for new and existing players in the beer industry.  Although the full potential of the industry has historically been held back because of a variety of regulatory constraints (most significant the taxation of beer with its lower alcohol content is being clubbed with that of spirits), there are signs of hope that the push towards the liberalisation of beer sales is finally making headway. </p>
<p>Looking at the more immediate term, one exciting development is the current rise in demand for premium lager in South Africa. With Diageo, Heineken and Namibia Brewery ramping up its presence through the joint venture company Brandhouse, created in 2004, Euromonitor International expects 2006 will be a year in which some of the foundations laid by the company will begin to reap rewards.</p>

<h3>Company to Watch</h3>
<h3>C&amp;C Group Plc –Brewers watch out!</h3>
<p>C&C Group Plc name has recently been linked to the success of its star brand Bulmer's, and although the company is not a brewer, Euromonitor expects the Irish cider producer to remain an exciting one to follow in 2006. With a number of comparable characteristics to that of beer – both have similar refreshing flavours, alcohol contents and price points and are traditionally sold in pint glasses in the UK and Ireland – cider is a prospective competitor to a niche product operating in the larger beer market.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International expects that the Irish drinks group will have a good year in the UK, having already seen healthy progress in both Ireland in 2005. New brand entrant, Magners, will use its experience of Ireland, its home market where it is branded as Bulmer's, to establish itself in the UK. Through advertising and promoting cider as a cold, refreshing drink, showing how cider can and should be consumed with ice, Magners has attracted younger Irish consumers away from beer and other drinks. It will undoubtedly seek to do the same in the British market where extra cold beer is enjoying success. Cider has also begun to gain ground in the South Africa market, and this is likely to intensify in 2006.</p>
<h3>Brand to Watch</h3>
<h3>Guinness</h3>
<p>Diageo's inability to reverse the ongoing volume erosion for the Guinness brand in its key markets in recent years has indeed put global drinks giant's long term commitment to the brand in question. 2005 saw the brand's volume sales decline its three largest markets, United Kingdom, Ireland and Nigeria, according to company reports.</p>
<p>Being a traditional stout among seven spirits brands, Guinness does not sit well in Diageo's portfolio of global priority brands. Its spirits brands are generally involved in faster-moving areas of the drinks market, benefiting from a younger consumer profile than Guinness, and as such are more suitable platforms from which to launch youth-orientated brand extensions. Meanwhile, the acquisition of some of Seagram's brands makes Diageo's business even more loaded towards spirits.</p>
<p>2006 will no doubt be interesting to observe Diageo's willingness to hold on to this prestigious Irish brand. From Euromonitor International's point of view, a complete sell-off of Guinness is unlikely, primarily because of Guinness's overall value to Diageo and the likelihood of a significant gap between Diageo's valuation and that of any potential bidder. However, given the necessity for Guinness to work with other brewers in joint ventures and Diageo's enthusiasm for this as a strategy, the continuation and development of further strategic alliances with major international groups – including existing partners like SABMiller and Heineken – is likely, with an outside possibility that this might lead, in due course, to some form of equity-based relationship.</p>

Premium potential for beer in the Baltic states,"The damaging effects of binge-drinking in the Baltic states, have prompted governments there to introduce strategies and policies to reduce alcohol consumption.

Euromonitor International believes beer producers currently operating in the Baltic states and those looking to enter this fast growing market must be ready to counter tighter regulations and slow shifting consumption patterns.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Evolution from binge-drinking culture to more moderate premium consumption</h3>
<p>Of the three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania per capita consumption of beer in both Estonia and Lithuania is particularly high by global standards with 85.5 litres per head in 2005 ranking Estonia just outside the world top 10 and considerably in advance of the Eastern European average of 61.4 litres. All three states exhibit per capita consumption levels well in excess of the global average of just over 24 litres, and for Latvians 58 litres per head in 2005 marked a 40% increase over the previous 5-year period. It is this upsurge in consumption and associated anti-social behaviour, such as alcoholism and drink-related motoring accidents that have persuaded authorities in the region to address the growing problem.</p>
<p>The traditional popularity of beer, which accounts for over two-thirds of total alcoholic drinks volume in all three Baltic States, has been underpinned by low prices as intense competition amongst dominant domestic brewers has held price rise to a minimum. Furthermore, conservatism amongst beer drinkers and brand loyalty have combined with the low prices to prevent imported beers gaining a strong foothold in the Baltic states, evidenced by local beers accounting for some 98% of total Lithuanian beer volume in 2005.</p>
<p>The slow evolution of drinking habits is resulting in a greater frequency of consumption but with a more measured approach to quantity. Indeed, quality is becoming a key purchase criterion and premium beers, both domestic and imported, have gained ground in all three Baltic States. Manufacturers are encouraging this shift by introducing new beers with higher ABVs and testing such innovations in trend-setting bars and nightclubs. Away-from-home consumption is playing a more significant role in the expansion of beer sales as producers eye the higher margins available in the on-trade. In 2005, some 33% of total beer consumption in the Baltic states was effected via the on-trade, up from less than 29% in 2000. However, this is a far cry from the near 48% of beer sales sold through on-trade establishments in Western Europe, where by contrast, the off-trade has gained ground over the same period.</p>
<h3>Lithuania largest, but Estonians greatest drinkers</h3>
<p>With almost  2.6 million hls and EUR369 million in 2005, Lithuania is the largest and most valuable beer market of the three Baltic States, but this pales in significance alongside the wider regional market, which amounted to over 200 million hls in 2005. However, Estonia, the smallest of three, is characterised by a high level of per capita consumption, particularly of premium lagers, which contributed to spending of EUR159 per head on beer in 2005, more than twice the Eastern European average. The Estonian government, in particular, has been notable in its efforts to modify drinking behaviour, with reform of its traffic laws, including more roadside stops and higher fines for drink driving, resulting in a significant fall in the number of traffic accidents where alcohol is involved.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian and Latvian markets show the greatest similarities in terms of structure with lager accounting for around 90% of total beer volume. On the other hand, dark beer represented a fifth of total beer sales in Estonia, demonstrating the popularity of seasonal dark products during Estonia's long cold winters. However, the key growth factor common to all three markets is increasing demand for premium variants as drinkers respond to overtures from governments and media, on the one hand, to curb their consumption, and on the other, from manufacturers, to trade up to higher-margin premium beers. This is resulting in changing habits as traditional binge-drinking behaviour is replaced by more cultured, moderate imbibing.</p>
<p>A more responsible approach to beer marketing has also been taken by manufacturers, with brewers in Lithuania setting down a new code of practices and regulations in late 2004. A key component of the Code of Honour of Lithuanian Brewers was an agreement by all signatories not to produce beer with an ABV in excess of 9.5%. On the other hand, in Latvia domestic brewers have taken new product development to the very edge of the Lithuanian limit, by introducing beers with 9.0-9.5% ABV.  In 2005, Latgales stiprais from Mamas D claimed an ABV of 9.5%, while both Turbo (Livu Alus Daritava) and Vanaga Ipasi Stiprais (Aldaris) featured ABVs of 9%. Although this segment currently accounts for just 1% of Latvia's beer market, a favourable change in the country's excise tax levels has made production of beers over 7% ABV more viable. The higher margins attracted by high-strength, quality beers have also persuaded local manufacturers, long constrained by intense price competition associated with standard and economy beers, that such developments offer a route to greater value sales.</p>

<h3>Duopolies in both Lithuania and Estonia, and triumvirate leads Latvia </h3>
<p>The duopolies that exist in both Lithuania and Estonia show few signs of weakening, as loss of share by leading brewer Baltic Beverages Holding AB (BBH) in both countries is offset by gains made by second-ranked Bryggerigruppen A/S (The Danish Brewery Group A/S) and Olvi Oyj respectively. In Lithuania, BBH claimed just under 43% of beer volume in 2004, almost 20 percentage points clear of Bryggerigruppen A/S, while in Estonia, the brewing operation jointly owned by Carlsberg and Scottish & Newcastle held a similar lead over Finnish brewer Olvi Oyj. Despite considerable efforts to shore up its position in Latvia, BBH's leadership was seriously compromised by an almost 14 percentage points loss of share over the period 2000-2004. Beneficiaries AS Cesu Alus (owned by Olvi Oyj) and Livu Alus Daritava each saw minor single-digit shares in 2000 transformed into solid double-digit shares by 2004. This was on the back of new product launches such as Cesu Gaisais and Cesu Premium (both from Cesu Alus and appearing for the first time in 2003) and Livu Gaisais from Livu Alus Daritava in 2002.</p>
<p>The concentrated nature of the Baltic beer markets is unlikely to change dramatically, with consumer conservatism compounded by the brewers' strategy of forging exclusive arrangements with both the on-trade and independent beer sellers. Leading brewer BBH continues to take an aggressive approach to selling its domestic beers and in Latvia, for example, requires that all its beers are sold in refrigerators and in return for the provision of free sunshades to pubs and bars demand exclusive sales of its products. With EU accession, Latvia is now governed by EU regulation, which may impact BBH's continuation of such restrictive practices. Further obstacles in the way of imported brands include heavy investment by domestic manufacturers in new products and packaging. In addition to lower prices, the introduction of twist-off screw-top bottles and domestic beer in cans by Kalnapilis Vilniaus Tauro grupe in Lithuania and new high-quality 1-litre PET packaging for BBH's Saku Originaal in Estonia has helped local brands maintain a competitive edge over imported products. </p>
<p>Black market sales remain a significant problem for the alcoholic drinks industry generally across the three Baltic States, a problem exacerbated in Latvia's beer market by government proscription of retail sales of beer with an ABV in excess of 5.5% after 20.00hrs. On the other hand, following EU accession, which brought excise duties for the three Baltic States into line with EU requirements, tourists can now transport up to 10 times more alcohol across internal borders. This is particularly relevant when one considers that beer prices in northern neighbour Finland are double those in Estonia. It has also contributed to Estonia's undesirable reputation as a drinker's paradise, with cheap flights to the country's capital Tallinn bringing tourists from all over Europe to take advantage of low beer prices. This has prompted authorities in Tallinn to launch an ad campaign in Finland, which makes no mention of cheap alcohol and instead emphasises the cultural and recreational attributes of Estonia's capital city.</p>
<h3>Where opportunities now lie in Baltic States</h3>
<p>Given the already high level of per capita beer consumption in the Baltic States, particularly Estonia, it is no surprise that the three markets are not expected to enjoy the same rates of expansion as other markets in Eastern Europe. By contrast, a more moderate approach to consumption and greater consumer sophistication will underpin the popularity of premium beers, providing one of the few avenues for imported brands to steal a march on domestic brews. It is foreseen that innovation in beer will increasingly initially be tested in the on-trade, and the off-trade is likely to lose its dominance. Strong brand images in bars and nightclubs in larger cities represents a clear opportunity for marketers to reach an increasingly affluent and receptive young audience.</p>

<p>In order overtake or even keep abreast of current leaders InBev and SABMiller a likely triumvirate is the merge of Heineken, Anheuser-Busch and Foster's. Euromonitor International assesses the implications of this three-way deal.</p>
<p>With continued malaise affecting key developed markets, and profitability the watchword, some experts state that it is necessary to have 20% volume share of a market to achieve critical mass. Based on Euromonitor's 2004 company shares, no player as yet has a 20% global share. In addition, it is widely held that brewers should be present in US, Japan, United Kingdom, Brazil, Mexico, Canada and Australia to generate the bulk of profits. Estimates from the World Beer Monopoly, for example, put the US as accounting for 30% of all beer profit globally. Other countries with attractive margins include South Africa, Venezuela and Colombia. </p>
<p>In that context then, would a three-way merge provide the combined force of Heineken, Anheuser-Busch and Foster's with the right balance?</p>
<h3>Superpower potential</h3>
<p>Certainly this hypothetical superpower would boast some notable synergies. Anheuser-Busch and Heineken would provide a strong backbone in North America and Western Europe, although its presence in the important UK market itself is comparatively low. Heineken would also bring an impressive presence in Eastern Europe to the table. Heineken's interests in CCU and Kaiser hold potential in Latin America as does its presence in premium lager in the region, including Brazil and Mexico. In Africa/Middle East, Heineken is represented by a series of key investments. In South Africa, the company is ranked third overall in beer although a long way behind SABMiller. Importantly though, it has a leading position within the fast growing premium lager sector there. </p>
<p>Foster's meanwhile is the dominant player in the Australasian market. It would provide a fledgling presence in Asia-Pacific, which combined with the regional assets of Anheuser-Busch and Heineken, which have both focused strongly on China in recent years, would generate a solid platform for further development. Efforts in China currently focused on developing beer demand and making it affordable so investment is far outweighing incoming revenue. In the future however, this is a country with explosive revenue potential.  </p>
<p>Distribution agreements provide evidence of a degree of existing co-operation between the three companies, which strengthens the case for compatibility. Heineken has recently entered into an agreement to distribute Budweiser in Russia, while it also distributes the brand in Italy. Notably, in addition, both Heineken and Anheuser-Busch hold distribution agreements with CCU for the Argentine market, for the Heineken and Budweiser brands respectively.</p>

<h3>Imported premium lager fit </h3>
<p>Switching to brand portfolio synergies, Budweiser provides a strong global backbone, with the addition of Bud Light, the world's number one beer brand, providing a dominant position in standard lager in North America. The Heineken brand, itself a global brand, is the leading label in premium lager in Western Europe and is a growing premium import in the US. Heineken is also well placed in Eastern Europe, with both star and local brands. Foster's holds a leading position in standard lager in Australasia and holds ambitions to be a leading beverages company in Asia-Pacific, in particular with regards to the premium/imported sectors. </p>
<p>Although Foster's has sold off its trademark Foster's lager brand in Europe, it has retained the brand elsewhere. With better distribution it could gain greater advantage in the burgeoning premium import segment in the US. Foster's Australian heritage could add a further fillip to Anheuser-Busch's current strategy of expanding its portfolio of imported, lager brands to its exclusive wholesaler network. Anheuser-Busch also has a US distribution deal with Tiger and interests in Tsingtao and Grupo Modelo but Foster's in addition to Heineken's sizeable Eastern European beer portfolio would give a major boost to the overall offering. </p>
<p>This new superpower would knock InBev off the top spot and take it closer to the 20% share required for critical mass. More crucially though it would give the combined force a much greater balance across regions, the ability to milk cash cow markets now with greater leverage to invest in lucrative emerging markets including the vast Chinese market. </p>",23344,1,152,2006-08-09 16:53:44,48866,39,2006-08-09 00:00:00,IWArticle
Brazil beer goes premium,"As the country becomes the world's third biggest beer consumer, premium manufacturers look set to conquer.","<p>As the country becomes the world's third biggest beer consumer, premium manufacturers look set to conquer.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Brazil has supplanted Germany as the third largest beer consumer by volume, with sales augmenting rapidly to 93.3 million hectolitres. Premium varieties have driven this growth, with volume sales increasing by over 200% in the last five years. Volume share has risen to 7% and, according to Euromonitor International's forecasts, will reach 15% by 2010. Manufacturers have been alert to this trend, with five new premium lagers, including Stella Artois (from Cia Brasileira de Bebidas) and Bavaria Premium (Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil), launched in 2005 alone. </p>
<h3>Opportunities knock </h3>
<p>Not only does Brazil have the fifth largest population in the world, it is estimated that three million potential beer consumers reach the legal drinking age each year. In addition, governmental efforts to narrow the gap between rich and poor have enabled more Brazilian consumers to experiment with premium beers. Young drinkers are particularly prone, viewing premium beer as a status symbol, particularly imported brands.</p>
<p>The current economic and political stability is a draw for foreign exporters. GDP is expected to grow at 4% annually between 2005 and 2010, leading to increased consumer spending power, and the appreciation of the local currency is certain to provoke a rise in imports. As a result, volume sales of premium lager are expected to grow by 186% by 2010. </p>
<h3>Acquisitions the key </h3>
<p>Various obstacles linger for international players. Since most beer is sold in 600ml returnable bottles (67% in 2005), significant capital is required to set up efficient bottling operations. Distribution is another hindrance, given the immense size of the country and the difficulty in supplying the more than one million points-of-sale. These pitfalls can be avoided through the acquisition of a local beer manufacturer. Since the January 2006 acquisition of Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil by the Mexican group FEMSA, Cervejaria Petropolis, which controls just over 4% of the beer market, remains the most attractive target. The company has its own distribution network, and its primary brand, Itaipava, has a strong reputation for being a premium beer sold at an economy price.</p>",23344,2,319,2006-09-08 19:11:09,49656,39,2006-09-08 00:00:00,IWArticle
Beer in your crisps,Kettle Foods launches a new crisps/chips line combining two popular items of the British snack food diet: beer and crisps/chips.,"<p>Kettle Foods launches a new crisps/chips line combining two popular items of the British snack food diet: beer and crisps/chips.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The new beer-flavoured line is positioned at the premium end of the market, and is targeted at a consumer segment willing to pay a premium for exotic flavours. The crisps/chips contain 4% of dried Adnams Co Plc's Ale and, as all other Kettle Food's products, are free from artificial colours and flavourings.</p>
<h3>Beer wins, chips/crisps lose </h3>
<p>Both beer and chips/crisps are very common British snacking items, with retail sales worth £4.5 billion and £1.2 billion respectively in 2006, according to Euromonitor International's figures. They are however, following different trends in growth terms. Beer sales have benefited from the increasing popularity of premium and dark varieties. By contrast, crisps/chips' growth in value has been dented by private label's pressure on prices and faltering demand due to the high fat content prompting health concerns.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 class=""analysisReportTableWrap"">Beer and Chips/crisps retail sales in UK (£mn)</h4>
<p><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\42214ca1-2012-47c2-b073-eaaed183e6cf.JPG""></p>
<p class=""analysisReportTableMeta emtablesource"">Euromonitor</p>
<h3>Combinations Become Global Trend </h3>
<p>The inclusion of flavours particularly popular among the local population to attract the consumer's attention is not exclusive of the UK market, but a global trend taking place in other developed markets. The latest example was the launch last summer by the Italian snack manufacturer San Carlo of Wacko's Blacks. The new crisps/chips line combines ketchup and paprika flavours. Ketchup is by far the flavour preferred by Italian children, who put it mainly on fries when eating fish and meat.</p>
<h3>More beer combinations on the horizon</h3>
<p>Other manufacturers are likely to follow Kettle Foods' lead by adding to their premium ranges different varieties of beer flavours. The possibilities are endless, given the British consumer ability to differentiate among a large number of different brands/varieties of beer.</p>
<p>Alliances between beer and crisps/chips manufacturers, through combined promotions in both the grocery and food channels is one strategy that might help to further sales. While some brand beers might be strong in the food service channel, they might leverage on the prominent position of chips/crisps manufacturers in grocery and vice versa. These alliances might prove crucial in the growth of both sectors in the medium term.</p>",373,1,173,2006-11-30 14:04:20,51357,39,2006-10-04 00:00:00,IWArticle

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Key premium brands, such as South African Breweries' Amstel, Brandhouse's Windhoek Lager and SABMiller's Castle Light are locked in an advertising battle to gain supremacy in the burgeoning premium lager segment. No wonder, since the segment has experienced volume growth of 213% in the last five years. SABMiller, the market leader with a share of 82%, has been especially proactive, launching its premium Peroni brand in 2005 and repackaging Castle as a “more premium-economy brand”.</p>
<h3>Economic equality </h3>
<p>Factors driving South Africa's premium segment include the introduction of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), which encourages the economic participation of the previously disadvantaged black and Indian populations. This scheme has caused the emergence of a large, black, middle-income group, whose aspirations are great and whose spending power continues to increase.</p>
<h3>Less is more </h3>
<p>Equally telling has been the government's emphasis on discouraging alcohol over-consumption. Increased penalties for drink-driving have been introduced, in addition to wide-ranging regulations to curb advertising. As a consequence, consumers appear inclined to drink less whilst, particularly in off-trade establishments, opting for more premium brands. The government's mooted plans to implement a full ban on alcohol advertising will, if they are implemented, further encourage this trend. </p>
<h3>SABMiller's dominance </h3>
<p>According to Euromonitor International's figures, the premium lager segment is forecast to see volume growth of 67% by 2010. The football World Cup, to be hosted in South Africa in 2010, will provide an additional boost, as premium beer companies increase their advertising expenditure to take advantage of the massive public exposure. </p>
<p>With its distribution networks, extensive advertising and 80% share of the beer market, SABMiller remains dominant. However, its share of the premium segment is being eaten away by Brandhouse, a joint venture formed in 2004 between Heineken, Namibian Breweries and Diageo. </p>
<p>Any new market entrant would require a local marketing machine capable of winning over a very brand- and status-conscious public. Rumours of a market entry by Anheuser-Busch continue to surface, but without the support of either SABMiller or Brandhouse, success seems unlikely.</p>",23344,1,319,2006-11-21 13:08:46,51547,39,2006-10-30 00:00:00,IWArticle

Kirin Brewery mixes beer and wine,The declining Japanese beer market is forcing the country's beleaguered brewers to diversify their portfolios and look overseas,"<p>The declining Japanese beer market is forcing the country's beleaguered brewers to diversify their portfolios and look overseas</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Japanese brewer Kirin Brewery announced in mid-November its intention to buy a controlling stake in the country's largest winemaker, Mercian Corporation. Driving the company's strategy is a desire to take advantage of Mercian's diverse portfolio, including wine, shochu and RTDs, whose rapidly growing popularity is steadily eroding sales of beer in Japan. Latest Euromonitor International data indicates that the Japanese markets for wine, shochu and RTDs are forecast to increase in volume by 13%, 31% and 24% respectively by 2011.</p>
<h3>The health impact </h3>
<p>Increased health-consciousness has provoked a gradual decline in beer sales, which have fallen in volume terms by almost 3% per annum since 2001. In addition to the reduced consumption by Japan's steadily ageing population, younger, fashion-conscious consumers are switching to healthier offerings out of a concern for personal appearance. Such trends are expected to continue, with per capita beer consumption forecast to decline from over 49 litres to less than 44 litres in the next five years. </p>
<p>In addition to seeking out opportunities in their national non-beer markets, Japanese brewers have been compelled to cast an eye on overseas markets. Kirin Brewery has, for example, acquired a 46% share in Australian brewer Lion Nathan and a 20% stake in Philippines-based San Miguel Corporation in a bid to drive growth. </p>
<h3>Exports the answer </h3>
<p>The Japanese government, whose finances have been diminished by a consumer shift towards the lightly taxed third generation beer, has stated its intention to raise taxes, posing a serious threat to brewers' profits. As such, the need for a diversified portfolio is urgent. Although Kirin's foray into Japanese wine may appear geographically limited, the growing popularity of Japanese wines in the markets of Western Europe and the US, in which Japanese food has long been successful, could open up two big export markets for exploitation. In addition, shochu, whose low margins are compensated for by the enormous volumes sold, estimated at over 1.1 billion litres in Japan, is equally popular in South Korea, providing an additional route for future expansion. </p>",23344,1,319,2006-12-13 11:43:53,60420,39,2006-12-13 00:00:00,IWArticle

<p>The vast potential of the Indian beer market has seen brewers rack up investment in the country. According to Euromonitor International's figures, the Indian beer market has recorded a 45% increase in volume sales between 2001 and 2006, and is forecast to grow by over 50% by 2011. Low per capita consumption of just under one litre (compared, for example, to China's 24 litres per capita) offers the potential for high, sustained growth. In addition, the country boasts not only the second largest population in the world but one which is growing rapidly, with over half a billion Indians under the age of 25. Lastly, annual disposable income has increased by an impressive 45% between 2000 and 2005. </p>

<p>Changing attitudes toward alcohol consumption are having a dramatic impact on the Indian market. State governments across the country are beginning to approve more licences for retail stores, as well as extending the operating hours of both on- and off-trade outlets. Young people and women are developing an increasingly 'western' view of drinking, leading to an upsurge in the popularity of lower alcohol drinks at the expense of spirits.</p>
<h3>Barriers to market entry cause multinationals to seek out joint ventures</h3>
<p>However, there remain significant barriers to market entry and growth, including heavy customs duties and exorbitant transportation costs, as well as the Indian authorities' reluctance to grant licenses for enlarging brewery capacity. These impediments have driven multinationals to seek out joint ventures with local brewers in order to gain a foothold in this valuable market. </p>
<p>Expected any day now is an announcement concerning the future of Mohan Meakin. The company's steady decline in market share to less than 8% has caused intense takeover speculation. Since January, InBev, Heineken, Anheuser-Busch and SABMiller have each expressed an interest, with SABMiller emerging as the clear frontrunner. In April, a deal between the two companies was postponed due to issues concerning Mohan Meakin's properties. However, the recent election of a new governor in Tamil Nadu and the subsequent possibility of beer tax reform could spark renewed talks. Such a deal would bolster SABMiller's presence in South India, particularly in the lucrative market of Tamil Nadu, which is frequently cited as the second largest beer-consuming state after Andhra Pradesh. It would also move SABMiller into a leading position, ahead of current leader United Breweries (excluding UB's joint venture with Millennium Alcobev).</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch, driven by saturation in its domestic US market, has been linked to joint ventures with both Crown Breweries, based near Hyderabad, and the S.K. Jaipuria Group, a New Delhi-based soft drinks manufacturer. Reports have suggested that the company is planning to focus on marketing while agreeing bottling arrangements with mid-sized brewers, rather than opting for an outright acquisition. </p>
<p>One of Japan's largest beer makers, Sapporo Breweries, is reportedly seeking to enter the market either by forming a joint venture or by acquiring existing breweries. It intends to launch its 'third beer' brand, Draft One, which is a beer-like, low-alcohol (5% ABV) beverage made from pea or soy protein. Due to the absence of malt and wheat, the product is categorised as neither a regular beer nor a low-malt beer. As in Japan, this could liberate Draft One from the high taxes imposed on beer, rendering it much more affordable to lower income consumers. </p>
<p>Strong beer, at around 8% ABV, is characteristic of this market. Companies like Anheuser-Busch will therefore have to introduce new, stronger variants to their portfolios if they intend to make significant in-roads in the short-term. Asia Pacific Breweries, in which Heineken owns a 42% stake, appears to be looking to boost its own portfolio. It is seeking to acquire a 76% stake in Lilasons Breweries, which owns the strong beer brand Khajuraho, present in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Lilasons is seen as one of the last few independent beer breweries left in India. </p>
<h3>Further impediments await foreign players</h3>
<p>Despite the sales potential India offers, the country's ban on alcohol advertising significantly hampers the ability of new brands to gain sufficient recognition to allow them to compete with the market leaders' better-known and well-established brands. However, United Breweries and SABMiller have managed to skirt such regulations through the launch of soft drinks named after their beer brands, the former with Kingfisher mineral water and the latter with Haywards 5000 soda. </p>
<p>As the leading foreign player in the beer market, SABMiller has first-mover advantage in the face of competition from new entrants. Indeed, SABMiller's reported desire to deepen its relationship with India's Kool Breweries, the company's bottler in the fast-growing northern states of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, which are subject to far less stringent duties on beer, is yet another step in the brewer's process of sewing up this market.</p>
<h3>Merger and acquisition activity to date:</h3>
<p>September 2006 - SABMiller acquires the Indian brewing assets of Foster's Group for US$120 million.</p>
<p>June 2006 - Asia Pacific Breweries forms a joint venture with the Jaipuria Group in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the country's largest beer market.</p>
<p>June 2006 - SABMiller strikes a bottling deal with Kool Breweries to serve the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>May 2006 - Asia Pacific Breweries acquires a 76% holding in Aurangabad Breweries for approximately US$18 million, with an option to buy the remainder at the end of 2008.</p>
<p>February 2006 – United Breweries and Scottish & Newcastle increase their individual stakes in their joint venture, Millennium Alcobev, by 10% each, giving the two companies a 50:50 stake.</p>
<p>May 2005 – SABMiller acquires Shaw Wallace Group's 50% interest in the brewing operations of SABMiller's Indian joint venture, Shaw Wallace Breweries, giving it a 99% holding.</p>
<p>January 2005 - Scottish & Newcastle buys a 37.5% stake in India's market leader, United Breweries, for US$106 million.</p>",23344,1,319,2006-12-11 17:48:25,60804,39,2006-12-11 00:00:00,IWArticle
Developing trends in beer and wine,"Flavoured and light beers look set for further development in 2007, alongside expected growth for sparkling wines, tastier low alcohol options and continued excitement for rosé.","<p>Flavoured and light beers look set for further development in 2007, alongside expected growth for sparkling wines, tastier low alcohol options and continued excitement for rosé.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Flavoured beers and light beers to gain momentum</h3>
<p>In developed markets, stagnant beer sales are driving companies towards further innovation. In 2007, launches of lower alcohol beers are expected to multiply, in light of greater consumer health consciousness and governments' progressively tough stance on drink driving. 2006 saw InBev release several lower-alcohol variants, including Jupiler Blue, Beck's Vier and Peeterman Artois. In 2007, Euromonitor International anticipates launches from the likes of Anheuser-Busch, SABMiller and Molson Coors, whose non-/low-alcohol offerings are dwarfed by those of InBev and Heineken. </p>
<p>Niche but premium products are expected to become increasingly important for brewers attempting to shore up sales in the large but stagnant markets of the US, the UK and Germany. Numerous launches of flavoured beers are anticipated, as brewers target younger consumers seeking an alternative to standard lager and for older consumers seeking something different. </p>
<h3>Sparkling wine more mileage to go for 2007</h3>
<p>Having seeing an impressive performance in the past couple of years, sparkling wines (excluding Champagne), are expected to experience a peak in 2007 with growth then softening thereafter as demand matures. While Euromonitor International forecasts that various countries across all regions will see an increase, Europe stands out in terms of strongest incremental gains. Heavyweights Italy, France, UK and Russia are expected to see further momentum in 2007. </p>
<h3>The new taste for low alcohol wines</h3>
<p>Faced with declining domestic wine consumption, a handful of French entrepreneurs have unveiled new lines of low-alcohol wines targeting young people, the health conscious and drivers. With harsher drink-driving policies, stricter regulations on the advertising of alcoholic products and campaigns intensively promoting responsible drinking, these new products may well be the start of a new wave of launches elsewhere in Europe. </p>
<p>Several of these new wines contain five to seven percent alcohol, half as much as in most normal wines, although in France, because of their lower alcohol content of less than 8.5% abv, they cannot be classified as wine. In other countries there is no such threshold, which may enable greater consumer acceptance</p>
<h3>Take a leaf from rosé</h3>
<p>Indeed, one of the reasons attributed to rosé's strong performance across various countries is the lower abv of around 10% that many of these wines have, a factor which makes is a more sessionable drink. Marketeers would do well to take a learning from rose's success and focus on the more enjoyable benefits of lower alcohol wine while keeping the health awareness message to the rear.</p>",239,1,8,2007-04-17 11:36:47,64603,39,2007-03-30 00:00:00,IWArticle

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Russia now moves into fourth place, ahead of Germany, with sales growing by 10% in 2006 which is double the rate of the previous year. Sales of beer benefited from a disruption in supply of spirits brought about by the introduction of tax strip stamps and controls designed to regulate trade. Demand for premium beer is also adding strong value growth as the sector, now reaching maturity, is seeing greater sophistication in terms of product and packaging offering. </p>
<h3>Mexican potential </h3>
<p>The other mover is Mexico which jumps ahead of the United Kingdom into seventh place, up by 6% in 2006. With a sizeable and growing population coupled with per capita volumes at 57 litres compared to 80-100 litres in mature markets like the US or Venezuela, Mexico is seen as holding strong potential. Companies are reaping rewards for investment as year-on-year growth in the past three years has been steady at between 5-6%. </p>

NPD - Salt and lime: beer flavour of the year?,"Two recent launches, Rock Ice Limon and Miller Chill, are attempting to extend the Mexican 'chelada' concept of consuming beer with lime juice and ice in a salt-rimmed glass. ","<p>Two recent launches, Rock Ice Limon and Miller Chill, are attempting to extend the Mexican 'chelada' concept of consuming beer with lime juice and ice in a salt-rimmed glass. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In Costa Rica, it was the trend for consuming Corona with salt and lime that led Florida Ice & Farm Co to produce its own version of chelada beer in Rock Ice Limon. Launched in 2005, the flavour extension has attracted new consumers to the Rock Ice brand and secured a 2.9% share of the market in 2006, making it the fourth most popular brand, well ahead of seventh-ranked Corona (1.1% share). </p>
<p>Miller Chill, another chelada-style beer, was introduced by SABMiller across the US in June 2007 as part of an effort to revive sales in the country. Unlike Rock Ice, which has a higher alcohol content than other Costa Rican beers, Miller Chill is a light beer. Sold at a 25% premium to Miller Lite, Chill will be a profitable extension for SABMiller should demand prove sustainable. The new launch has exceeded expectations, surpassing its goal of selling 400,000 barrels in the first year to May 2008 this month (November). </p>
<p>Although chelada-style beer has proved popular in Costa Rica, it is still too early to assess whether Miller Chill's “refreshment” positioning leaves the brand vulnerable to seasonable fads. However, the growing trend towards tequila consumption in the US (8.6% CAGR by total volume over the past five years) may be a good indicator of the current appeal of Latino drinks in this market. Given the success of Miller Chill over the warmer months, SABMiller has recently begun selling Miller Chill in Australia, just in time for the summer. Time will tell whether “salt and lime” meets with more success than another Mexican-inspired concept, tequila-flavoured beer. Anheuser-Busch's Tequiza tequila flavoured-beer has struggled to develop a niche for itself in the US market with sales dropping from 34.6mn litres in 2000 to 1.25mn litres in 2006. </p>

Big Cola maker takes on beer giants,"Industrias Añaños, the privately-owned Peruvian beverages multinational, made its first foray into alcoholic drinks in September this year, launching Franca beer in its domestic market.","<p>Industrias Añaños, the privately-owned Peruvian beverages multinational, made its first foray into alcoholic drinks in September this year, launching Franca beer in its domestic market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\9276ab94-968b-4043-9856-d68e98a82516.jpg""><p>For its expansion into beer, the Andean company is employing a strategy similar to the one used to break into the soft drinks market: selling beverages in big volume bottles at lower prices than the major players. With soft drinks operations in 10 Latin American countries, Industrias Añaños is the fourth largest carbonates player globally and one of the fastest growing, posting off-trade volume growth of 17% in 2006, compared with 3% for The Coca-Cola Company and 2% for PepsiCo according to Euromonitor International. The company's flagship cola carbonates brands, Big Cola and Kola Real, have prospered despite the dominance of the aforementioned industry giants, and the high barriers that their presence represents.</p>
<p>A no-frills operation, Industrias Añaños undercuts competing brands Coca-Cola and Pepsi on price with little advertising, relying instead on word of mouth, and leaves distribution to third parties. Although the lack of its own distribution fleet and cooler supply deals could be considered a weakness, not least because it does not have complete control and because in terms of being a potential acquisition target, Latin American companies are often bought for their distribution networks, this approach has proved successful for the company in the soft drinks arena and the existing distribution arrangements can easily be leveraged for the distribution of beer as well. </p>
<h3>Competitive constraints</h3>
<p>Franca is being introduced as Peru is experiencing intense price wars. The entry of Industrias Añaños into the high growth Peruvian beer market has placed the company in direct competition with multinational brewers SABMiller and InBev. SABMiller has been present in the market since 2005 when it acquired Colombian-based Bavaria, which owned Backus, and has a 95% share of the beer market by total volume. In 2006, the company invested US$102 million in Peru, an indicator of its commitment to this market. Despite being a much smaller player (with 3.5% of the market), InBev is another force to be reckoned with. Since launching its global Brahma brand in Peru in 2005, the company has competed aggressively on price to pressure SABMiller's dominant brands. </p>
<p>The move into beer will have its challenges but the company has a successful track record in the soft drinks market and is no stranger to major competitors. Despite the intensely competitive environment, Industrias Añaños has the advantage of being a domestic company with great knowledge of the Peruvian market and its characteristics. It has some experience of entering into product adjacencies since it recently entered the snacks market in which it has seen initial success. As well as gaining share from existing players, its low-price strategy enables the company to attract Peruvians, mainly from less affluent segments, who did not previously consume such products. If the company is successful in attracting new consumer segments in beer then it might co-exist well with other players, at least in the short to medium term while there remain consumers on very low incomes. </p>

<h3>The next rising star in Latin America?</h3>
<p>Peru has one of the lowest beer consumption rates in Latin America (31 litres per capita compared to 96 litres in Venezuela and 52 litres in Mexico), which makes the country an attractive target for brewers. Both multinational and domestic companies have invested in the country and as a result new brands are frequently launched making the industry more dynamic. However, Peruvian consumers remain price-sensitive, which influences consumption patterns. Industrias Añaños, a local company with domestic knowledge, seems ideally placed to take advantage of the distinct opportunity to boost beer consumption in Peru by offering a reasonably priced, quality beer. According to news reports, the company is initially aiming for a 10% share of the Peruvian beer market, which would place it ahead of InBev in terms of volume sales.  </p>
<p>If the move into beer proves successful in Peru, the company may consider reproducing the formula in other countries in which it already has a strong position in soft drinks. Mexico, Industrias Añaños' biggest market for soft drinks, would seem the obvious choice, but the company would face the duopoly of Grupo Modelo and FEMSA, which control 98% of the market. Both companies already have economy brands on offer, however neither Grupo Modelo's Tropical (which retails at MX$13.15 [US$1.17] per litre) nor FEMSA's Kloster (MX$14.04 [US$1.25] per litre) account for more than 0.1% of the total beer market by volume. This is because sales of economy lager are miniscule in Mexico, accounting for less than 0.5% of beer sales by total volume. Interest in low-end lagers is, however, increasing with foreign brands (such as Gallo, an economy lager from Guatemala) showing some success. In fact, Mexico was where Industrias Añaños first attempted to venture into the beer market with a 2005 plan to build a brewery. The project was scrapped, however, after new laws were passed in Mexico to tax beer sold in non-returnable bottles and cans at a higher rate than returnable bottles presenting an additional hurdle for new entrants alongside their other start-up costs.</p>

Mid-strength beers offer full-strength profit,"Brewers are launching mid-strength extensions of major beer brands.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Brewers have launched mid-strength variants of the leading beer brands in Belgium (Jupiler Blue), the UK (Carling C2) and Australia (VB Midstrength). Lowering the alcohol content of beer is an astute move on the part of manufacturers. For example, earlier this year the Foster's Group changed the strength of its 'regular strength' Victoria Bitter from 4.9% ABV to 4.8% ABV to cut the amount of excise the company pays on the beer it brews. This move is expected to save the company approximately A$10 million (US$8.57million) a year in excise tax payments without a discernable change in the taste of the beer to consumers. Additionally, these mid-strength beers tend to retail for a higher price per litre than their full-strength counterparts (eg Jupiler Blue is 13% more expensive per litre than Jupiler) making these products even more profitable for brewers. </p>
<p>Mounting concerns over binge drinking and drink driving are expected to result in a higher degree of social responsibility. Manufacturers are jumping on the bandwagon as public health campaigns gain momentum and regulations are tightened to promote responsible alcohol consumption. These beers appeal to consumers looking to lower their alcohol intake while still enjoying the flavour of regular-strength brands as well as consumers who do not typically consume beer. In Cameroon, for example, Castel Groupe's 3.8% ABV Beaufort Light beer (launched in June 2006) captured 0.5% of the total beer market by volume in 2007 without diminishing the share of its regular strength counterpart (4.6% ABV Beaufort). In addition to appealing to men (who are not seen to be drinking a weak, 'unmanly' beer) these lower-alcohol products also appeal to females, a growing consumer group for beer. </p>
<p>The next development in mid-strength beer could come from Guinness. Last year Diageo launched a mid-strength draught Guinness variant (with 2.8% ABV instead of 4.2% ABV) on a trial basis in Limerick designed to appeal to more responsible and health-conscious drinkers.</p>

NPD – Home draught systems boost beer sales,"In traditional Western European beer producing countries where consumption is slowly declining, brewers have introduced home draught systems in an attempt to invigorate off-trade sales.","<p>In traditional Western European beer producing countries where consumption is slowly declining, brewers have introduced home draught systems in an attempt to invigorate off-trade sales.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In mature markets such as the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium not only is the beer sector contracting by total volume, but the shift from the on-trade to the off-trade has also eroded value sales. Indeed, in the Netherlands, value sales are declining at a faster rate than overall volume. Consequently, manufacturers are focusing on improving the quality of the beer drinking experience with the aim of adding value to the market and taking advantage of the prevailing cocooning and home entertainment trends. </p>
<p>Home draught systems such as the BeerTender (from Heineken) and PerfectDraft (from InBev) target the macho 20-35-year- old male market, offering a more sophisticated way of drinking and serving beer at home. InBev launched its home draught beer system in 2004/2005 in conjunction with Philips. In the Netherlands, the product has been so successful that InBev extended the range of beers available in these kegs with the introduction of the popular Leffe brand in 2006 and the white beer Hoegaarden in the summer of 2007, when white beer is most often consumed. Heineken's BeerTender, a similar at-home system that holds a 4-litre keg of Heineken, was developed in conjunction with Krups, the designer product company, and launched in 2005. </p>
<p>These systems have helped InBev and Heineken to stimulate off-trade sales over the past couple of years, having a similar effect as coffee pod machines (such as Senseo developed by Philips and Sara Lee) have had in coffee, allowing consumers to experience the same taste quality as in the on-trade. Additionally, they have helped to raise unit prices; however, this is expected to be a short to medium-term effect as more competitors start developing similar products. Heineken plans to maintain consumer demand with further innovations, paying close attention to changes in consumer habits. New extensions in terms of packaging and products will aim to stimulate a sector under pressure. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International has identified the UK and Denmark as potential markets for home draught systems. Besides being major markets for beer with declining per capita consumption, sales of coffee pods in these countries have shown strong growth over the past three years, indicating that consumers are willing and able to spend on such beverage preparation systems. </p>

On-trade channel dominates beer sales in Cameroon,"In Cameroon, a country which traditionally has one of the highest levels of beer consumption in Africa next to South Africa, on-trade consumption accounts for 94% of total volume sales. This unique situation is due to the existence of local bars, known as beer parlours, which allow Cameroonians to consume beer on-premise at inexpensive prices. ","<p>In Cameroon, a country which traditionally has one of the highest levels of beer consumption in Africa next to South Africa, on-trade consumption accounts for 94% of total volume sales. This unique situation is due to the existence of local bars, known as beer parlours, which allow Cameroonians to consume beer on-premise at inexpensive prices. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Incongruous by nature, beer parlours are essentially shops where one can buy drinks at retail prices for consumption either on or off the premises. These shops often contain a bar counter or a few tables where customers can consume beer. Often, if such facilities are not provided, people will drink in front of the shop on upturned beer crates. Although beer parlours do not have the right to serve alcohol on-premise, the situation is tolerated by the government and these local bars are immensely popular, accounting for approximately 90% of on-trade beer sales in Cameroon.  </p>
<p>As beer parlours cater mainly for locals, prices are generally lower than in supermarkets and specialist outlets, which are mostly frequented by more affluent Cameroonians and expats. As 75% of off-trade beer sales are through specialist outlets which are much more expensive than local bars, in Cameroon prices in the on-trade are actually lower than in the off-trade. This is an exceptional occurrence. For example, although similar unlicensed outlets that sell mostly alcohol, which can be consumed on-premise, exist in Nigeria, they are not as pervasive as in Cameroon. Despite being the main on-trade channel in Nigeria and offering consumers relatively cheap beer, on average off-trade unit prices remain lower than on-trade unit prices.   </p>
<p>According to Euromonitor International on-trade channels will continue to perform well in Cameroon, mainly thanks to the continued dominance and expansion of beer parlours. Additionally, the consumption of beer in traditional bars, restaurants and hotels is expected to increase slightly with the improvement in Cameroonians' purchasing power over the mid to long term. However, it must be noted that the existence of beer parlours is dependent on government policy. If the government were to become more stringent about enforcing licensing laws, the situation could well change. In Kenya, for example, rural shops used to sell alcohol at the same price whether consumption was on the premises or at home; however, these outlets no longer exist following a crackdown on licensing.</p>

Light offerings widen the beer demographic,"With female drinking on the up, the time seems ripe for low-calorie and low-carbohydrate (light) beers to extend their reach beyond the US market.","<p>With female drinking on the up, the time seems ripe for low-calorie and low-carbohydrate (light) beers to extend their reach beyond the US market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Light lagers are particularly popular in the US where Bud Light is the leading beer brand with a 20% share of the market by total volume in 2006. Other light beers including Miller Lite, Coors Light, Natural Light and Busch Light also feature in the top 10 beer brands. Outside the US, light beers have had little impact on the market. However, Euromonitor International believes that light beers represent an emerging trend, especially in countries where awareness of weight issues is acute. Light lagers appeal chiefly to women who wish to control their waistlines but lack the will to completely eliminate high-calorie foods and beverages from their diets.</p>
<h3>Tapping into obesity fears</h3>
<p>In the UK, light beers have struggled in the past due to poor consumer perception in an age of 'lad culture' and copious alcohol consumption. Bud Light flopped badly and was withdrawn from sale in 2000, while Coors failed to make a success of its Coors Light brand. Coors tried again in January 2004, changing the name of the beer to Coors Fine Light in order to avoid the problem with the original launch, which was that consumers did not understand what the term “light” actually meant when applied to beer; however, once again it met with little success.</p>
<p>However, with a developing obesity problem, UK consumers are increasingly aware of the link between calorie content and alcohol. This dovetails neatly with responsible drinking messages which are seeking to dampen the binge drinking culture of the UK and a number of launches including Carling C2 and Becks Vier, dubbed 'session beers', have appeared offering mid-strength alcohol products with the taste of continental strength brands. In 2006, Cobra Low Calorie, an extension of the niche Cobra brand, which is promoted as less gassy, saw sales rocket with female drinkers buying into its well-positioned advertising. The success of Cobra Low Calorie may be a sign that although this may well be a slow burning sector, it might gain momentum in the future.</p>
<p>In Australia, low-carbohydrate light offerings are gaining popularity among health-conscious consumers, particularly females aged 35 years and below with high disposable incomes. In Australia, the low-carb category has been boosted by recent launches which also tap into the premiumisation trend. Foster's Pure Blonde, launched in 2005, is a low-carb beer with an alcohol content of 4.6%, which is slightly lower than the usual level of 4.9% for full-strength domestic Australian beer. 2006 saw the launch of copycat low-carb beers including premium lagers Carlton Dry, another Foster's offering, and Hahn Super Dry, from Lion Nathan. Reduced-carbohydrate beer is growing in popularity and could reach up to 10% of total beer volume in Australia by 2012 according to Euromonitor International.</p>
<p>Norway is another market in which consumers are turning to low-carb beer following Carlsberg's 2007 launch of the first low-carb beer on the market, Ringnes Lite (with 30% fewer calories and 70% fewer carbohydrates). In the same year Carlsberg launched another low-carb light beer, Tuborg Lite, and other me-too brands including Hansa Ultra Lavkarbo, with 20% fewer calories and 60% fewer carbohydrates, were launched. These light beers targeting women (a growing consumer segment) have met with success in the Norwegian market despite the ban on advertising of alcoholic drinks. Between them Ringnes Lite and Tuborg Lite beer already achieved a near 5% share of total volume sales in July 2007. </p>
<p>The success of other light beverages might be a good indicator of potential opportunities for light beer. Norway, for example, has the highest consumption of low-calorie carbonates in the world, with almost half of cola sales being low-calorie products. The success of low-calorie carbonates in other Western European countries including Belgium, the UK and Denmark as well as in North America, Australasia, Argentina and South Africa suggests that there is significant potential for light beers, as consumers are already familiar with the concept of low-calorie products.</p>

<h3>Learning from Coke – Light and Zero</h3>
<p>Although outside the US light beer products are mainly targeted at women, Euromonitor International believes that there is potential to develop new low-calorie and low-carb beers targeting male drinkers. In order to appeal to men, manufacturers will need to avoid words such as 'light' or 'diet'. One can expect to see a development similar to that in cola carbonates, where Coke Zero was launched as an alternative to Coke Light. Dubbed 'Coke for blokes' Coke Zero is aimed at the growing number of health-conscious male consumers who want to drink cola carbonates but are put off by the feminine image of brands like Diet Coke. Although on a global scale sales of Coke Zero remain miniscule compared to those of Diet Coke, in countries where Coke Zero has been launched it has not only boosted sales of low-calorie cola carbonates but it has also prevented a poorer performance of the carbonates sector as a whole.</p>

Henan Jinxing is the second largest independent brewer in China with the other brewer being Beijing Yanjing. Henan Jinxing is increasing it volumes faster than the market average and several competitors with a CAGR 2000-06 of 24.5%, which has enabled it to become China's sixth largest brewer with a 4.8% market share. Globally this has seen it break into the world's top 20 brewers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>International players keen to develop Chinese links</h3>
<p>Anheuser-Busch, InBev, Carlsberg, Asahi, Kirin, Suntory and Heineken have seen the potential of the rapidly expanding Chinese market and have made investments in companies already operating there. In the past Henan Jinxing has been rumoured to be looking for a foreign suitor and has twice been linked with Anheuser-Busch without any formal agreement forthcoming. </p>
<p>The rise in consumption is not the only reason for the company leap into the top of the brewer rankings. Henan Jinxing has also out performed the growth in the Chinese market due to its geographic distribution being predominately in the Mid and East China region which has had some the highest percentage growth for the Chinese market in terms of per cap consumption and volumes coupled with a huge population in these regions. The regions biggest selling brand is Jinxing which is classed as an economy beer, and also ranks as the sixth biggest selling brand in China with a 3.2% market share in 2006. </p>
<h3>Economy lager still dominant, but premium and standard lager on the rise</h3>
<p>The economy lager is the largest sector within the beer market in China making up 90% of the market in 2006; this is forecasted to fall to 86% in 2012 but still increase in volume. The Chinese beer market in the period 2007-12 is expected to grow in volume by over 35%. The growth rate of the premium and standard lagers is expected to outperform the market; Henan Jinxing has launched both premium and standard brands recently and could capture the trend in this higher margin market. </p>
<p>The company is expanding in the east of China, planning to reactivate the Tancheng Hualing brewery in Shandong Tancheng to increase capacity. The company has also stated that is keen to expand across more regions in China growing its consumer base. It has started this process with opening a production base in Nanjing in 2005 expanding into Eastern China. </p>
<h3>Foreign or Domestic Investment a Strong Possibility</h3>
<p>With eight out of the top ten brewers in China having some level of foreign ownership ranging from majority ownership to minority holdings, the Chinese market has captured the wallets of the major international players looking at the increasing consumption and rising wealth in the country. With the top ten brewers having a combined market share of 67.7% in 2006 up from 36.9% in 2000 illustrates the rate of consolidation within the Chinese market. This increasing consolidation has left little room for acquisition targets within the country and the two brewers that are left as independent or state owned are the only realistic opportunities left. </p>
<p>Henan Jinxing would be a good target for most foreign brewers and domestic players looking to increase their footprint in China. The investment of cash and skills of any large brewer should also help Henan Jinxing increase its presence in the market with resources to help develop new higher end products and regions. Potential suitors include nearly all of the major international brewers and some of the larger Chinese brewers looking to increase brewing operations in the Mid and Eastern regions of China. </p>",23323,1,430,2008-04-17 10:16:42,90670,39,2008-04-08 00:00:00,IWArticle
Hong Kong government axes duty tax on wine and beer,"The abolition of import duties on beer, wine and all alcoholic drinks except spirits is expected to promote the development of Hong Kong as the wine trading and distribution hub for Asia.","<p>The abolition of import duties on beer, wine and all alcoholic drinks except spirits is expected to promote the development of Hong Kong as the wine trading and distribution hub for Asia.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\0a984d06-f809-4d20-81fd-ab2a28a67d0f.jpg""><p>The removal of taxes on alcoholic drinks (announced on 27 February 2008) is part of a wider move in which a variety of taxes were slashed in a bid to stimulate investment and retain the territory's economic competitiveness as it posted a record budget surplus of HK$115.6 billion (US$14.8 billion). The tariff abolition follows a round of tax cuts on beer and wine last year which saw the duty on beer and other alcoholic drinks with no more than a 30% alcohol content halved from 40% to 20%, while that on wine was halved from 80% to 40%. To date, spirits have been exempt from tax cuts due to government concerns regarding the impact of spirits consumption on health.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong is a free port with no tariffs on general imports, duties were imposed on alcoholic drinks products, tobacco, hydrocarbon oil and methyl alcohol. The decision to lower taxes on beer and wine in 2007 and then remove them this year was driven by a number of factors. In addition to strong economic growth and the resultant budget surplus, coordinated lobbying efforts by advocates including consulates, trade and the tourism industry as well as the lack of consumer group objections to the tax reductions implemented last year also prompted the abolition of taxes.</p>
<p>The high level of taxation on alcoholic drinks has been a major obstacle to the country's development as a regional hub for wine trading and distribution. In fact, following the elimination of taxes, further measures, including the removal of administrative controls, are expected in order to facilitate increased import, export and storage of alcoholic beverages in Hong Kong. </p>
<h3>Asian wine hub</h3>
<p>Growing Asian affluence (the region has the seen the highest growth of GDP measured at purchasing power parity, 10% CAGR between 2002 and 2007) has made the region an important source of growth for the world wine trade. Wine consumption in Asia has risen sharply in recent years (total volume sales were up by 9% between 2005 and 2007, accounting for almost 50% of global volume gains over this period) and the region is forecast to see the most dynamic wine growth over the next five years. It is estimated that 40% of the US$1.3 billion worth of fine wine traded annually in London is already being sold to consumers from Hong Kong and mainland China, signalling a distinct opportunity to shift business to Hong Kong. In fact, following the removal of taxes, Hong Kong is set to become the third wine trading hub globally, after London and New York.</p>
<p>Wine prices in Hong Kong are likely to fall by between 15% and 20% which will give the territory an edge over rivals such as Singapore and Tokyo. Additionally, the territory's proximity to mainland China is advantageous as over time the country will become more and more important as a fine wine market. With its population of 1.3 billion, the expanding Chinese market will be one of the greatest demand forces impacting wine in Hong Kong. Hong Kong now shares many of the attributes that have made London a wine trading hub - low duties, lack of domestic producers and a strong consumer base. London International Vintners Exchange (Liv-ex), the London-based electronic exchange for fine wine, is expected to set up a Hong Kong office to capitalise on the growing market in China. The Hong Kong Trade Development Council is organising the first Hong Kong International Wine Expo which will be held in August 2008, providing a business platform for trade players to exchange and explore opportunities.</p>
<h3>Demand set to rise</h3>
<p>Trading aside, the tax reforms are likely to benefit demand for wine with prices expected to fall by between 15% and 20%. The developing wine drinking culture in Hong Kong has been fostered by hotels and restaurants which organise wine tasting and appreciation classes to educate consumers. Along with growing consumer sophistication, the tax abolition will encourage consumers to drink more and drink higher quality wines. Consumption of wine (which currently stands at under two litres per capita in Hong Kong) will be boosted, with fine wines expected to see the most significant increase. </p>
<p>The most popular countries of origin for wine imported into Hong Kong are France, Australia, the US, Chile, Spain and Italy (these six countries accounted for 90% of imported volumes last year). Following last year's tax cuts, wine imports reached HK$1.6 billion and 23.5 million litres in 2007, growth of 92% and 27% respectively. Effects of the tax abolition are expected to be even more marked. </p>
<h3>Spirits next?</h3>
<p>Despite the removal of taxes on beer and wine and lobbying by trade organisations including The European Spirits Organisation (CEPS), taxes on spirits have not been reduced and currently stand at 100%. Just as Asia is emerging as an important market for fine wine, the region is becoming an increasingly significant market for international spirits producers, particularly for products like Scotch whisky, although the current high level of tax for the product in the region is a cause for concern among manufacturers.</p>

Mid-strength beer gains momentum in Australia,"Mid-strength beer, historically popular in Queensland but virtually unknown elsewhere, has made strong inroads on a national basis, led by Carlton Mid Strength and VB Midstrength.","<p>Mid-strength beer, historically popular in Queensland but virtually unknown elsewhere, has made strong inroads on a national basis, led by Carlton Mid Strength and VB Midstrength.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Following the successful introduction of reduced-carbohydrate beer in 2005, strong demand for healthier types of beer has seen the mid-strength beer category gaining prominence and growing strongly nationally. While full-strength Australian beers have traditionally been around 4.9% alcohol by volume, mid-strength beers contain around 3.5% abv. Growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including an increase in the average age of beer drinkers, increasing female consumption, dissatisfaction with low-alcohol products and escalating concerns about drink-driving. </p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2006, combined sales of major mid-strength brands XXXX Gold (Lion Nathan), Carlton Mid Strength (Foster's Group), Toohey's Gold (Lion Nathan), Swan Gold (Lion Nathan) and Powers Gold Label (Foster's Group) were up by 19% in total volume terms, while overall lager sales grew by just 2% according to Euromonitor International. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the mid-strength category will continue along a dynamic path. The extension of Australia's leading beer brand (Victoria Bitters, or VB) into mid-strength has boosted the category on a national level. In fact, the April 2007 launch of VB Midstrength by Foster's has been hailed as one of the most significant recent launches in beer along with Pure Blonde, a reduced-carbohydrate beer launched by Foster's in 2005. </p>
<p>A defining characteristic of the Australian alcoholic drinks market is the emulation of success. In much the same way as the success of Pure Blonde triggered a host of “me-too” reduced-carbohydrate beers, Euromonitor International expects other companies will follow the lead created by Foster's and other pioneers of perceived healthier alternatives. Furthermore, the strong acceptance of Pure Blonde, the strong growth in mid-strength beer and the continuing decline of low-alcohol beer are all clear signs of where new product development will be focused over the forecast period.</p>

Tough times ahead for strong beers,"Although the strong beer trend appears to be gaining momentum as brewers introduce a wider range of products to stimulate interest in the beer category and boost value sales, these products conflict with initiatives to encourage responsible drinking and reduce alcohol consumption. ","<p>Although the strong beer trend appears to be gaining momentum as brewers introduce a wider range of products to stimulate interest in the beer category and boost value sales, these products conflict with initiatives to encourage responsible drinking and reduce alcohol consumption. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Strong beers, those with an alcohol content of more than 6% abv, are most popular in Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe, markets in which consumers are accustomed to drinking high-strength alcoholic beverages and where stronger beers are more in line with national tastes. In India, for example, 7% and 8% abv beers are very popular, with three of the four top-selling beer brands (UB Group's Kingfisher Strong, SABMiller's Haywards 5000 and Knock Out) containing 8% abv. Euromonitor International estimates that strong beers account for over 50% of total beer sales by volume in India. </p>
<p>Multinational brewers have launched their own strong beer brands to compete with local brews in order to make inroads into the lucrative Indian market. In early 2007 Carlsberg, through its joint venture South Asia Breweries, acquired the Himneel brewery in Himachal Pradesh, where it has started to brew the Polish beer brand Okocim Palon, which is positioned as a strong beer and competes directly with UB Group's Kingfisher Strong and SABMiller's Haywards 5000. Crown Beers India Ltd, the joint venture between Anheuser-Busch and Crown International, launched Armstrong Strong beer in May 2007 (7% abv) and Cobra Beer launched an 8% abv variant, King Cobra, in order to remain competitive in the Indian market. </p>
<p>As the Indian market becomes more crowded with strong beers, domestic players are stepping up their efforts. The UB Group, for example, has actively focused on building sales of Kingfisher Strong. Initiatives including the introduction of branded coolers and massive on-trade promotions have supported strong growth, with sales of India's leading beer brand up by 53% in 2006 according to Euromonitor International.</p>
<p>The strong beer phenomenon is not unique to the Indian market. In the Philippines, San Miguel Corp's 6.5% abv Red Horse Beer, the second largest beer brand in the market, accounted for 16% of beer sales in 2006 according to Euromonitor International. The popularity of strong beers in the Philippines is due to national tastes as well as economic factors. As economic conditions resulted in reduced disposable income, consumers have demonstrated greater interest in products with higher alcohol content including Red Horse Beer and SABMiller's 6.5% abv Colt 45 Malt Liquor, which offer the same effect (intoxication) more quickly and for less money.</p>
<h3>Widening the beer offering</h3>
<p>In much the same way as brewers are introducing mid-strength beers (containing around 4% abv) to offer consumers more choice depending on the drinking occasion, the introduction of stronger beers may stimulate interest and go some way to retaining beer drinkers in the category. </p>
<p>Although a number of beer brands in Eastern Europe have high abv variants (containing around 7% or 8% abv) none of these has a significant share of the market at present. However, Euromonitor International expects that high abv beers will find a receptive consumer base in this region given consumer preferences for stronger drinks (as evidenced by the popularity of drinking spirits, particularly vodka, neat). In 2006 in Russia, Ochakovo launched Kuban Svetloye, an extra-strong beer with 11% abv and in late 2007 Carlsberg launched Lav 7 beer in Serbia. At 7.2% abv this is the strongest beer available in the Serbian market but it is not nearly as strong as a recent launch in Germany. Late last year, Czech brewer Drinks Union launched a 10% abv beer (Doppel-Doppel Bock) in Germany and there are plans to export this product to the US. This product is expected to fare quite well on the German market as there is a trend for consuming different beers for different occasions, ie although non-alcoholic and beer mixes are gaining in popularity, there is also rising demand for beer with high alcoholic content and stronger tastes.</p>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>Government actions to curb drink driving and encourage responsible drinking pose a threat to these niche products. In the UK, Sainsbury's was banned from selling strong beers and ciders with an alcohol content over 5.5% abv at one of its London stores in late 2007 while Westminster City Council has introduced a voluntary scheme encouraging supermarkets and off-licences to drop products with more than 6% abv, including Carlsberg Special Brew, Tennants Extra and Diamond White cider. </p>
<p>Even if governments do not go to the extreme of banning certain products, regulations are a way of restricting sales of strong beers. In Belarus, where there is a huge low-income consumer group who simply want alcoholic drinks in order to become intoxicated for as little expense as possible, the government has introduced an array of measures to halt the spread of alcoholism under the title “Combating Drinking and Alcoholism 2006-2010”. These include raising the excise tax on beer with an abv content higher than 7% to four times the level for beer with an abv content of up to 7%.</p>

Brewer takes beer upmarket in Colombia to boost sales,"As one of the major beer markets in Latin America, and with beer sales forecast to grow by 17% over the next five years, Colombia is a market to watch. Additionally, per capita consumption is relatively low (43 litres in 2007, while on average consumers in Brazil and Mexico drank 55 litres each) and perceptions of beer, traditionally viewed as a downmarket choice, are improving.","<p>As one of the major beer markets in Latin America, and with beer sales forecast to grow by 17% over the next five years, Colombia is a market to watch. Additionally, per capita consumption is relatively low (43 litres in 2007, while on average consumers in Brazil and Mexico drank 55 litres each) and perceptions of beer, traditionally viewed as a downmarket choice, are improving.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Economic attractiveness</h3>
<p>Colombia has opened up its economy considerably since the early 1990s. In May 2003 tax reforms on alcoholic drinks came into effect, resulting in a simplified system and reduced tax duties. As a result of these changes, the price differential between imported and domestic products decreased. This has had a positive effect on imported products and has resulted in reduced contraband sales. </p>
<p>In addition to an improved tax system, Colombia's strengthening economy makes the country attractive to multinational brewers. The economy is growing strongly, boosted by improving levels of FDI. Colombia is increasingly being seen as a safe place to invest, with investors now looking at its regional attractiveness in terms of a skilled labour force, close links to the US (a free trade treaty was agreed by the Colombian and US governments in 2006, but has stalled in the US Congress. However, US President Bush has recently made the passing of a free trade agreement with Colombia one of his administration's top priorities) and investor-friendly legislation. In 2007, Colombia was ranked 66th out of 178 countries in the World Bank's 2007 Ease of Doing Business Index. Only Chile and Peru were ranked higher in the region, at 33rd and 58th respectively.</p>
<h3>SABMiller – the giant</h3>
<p>For beer giant SABMiller, entering the Colombian market has certainly been a positive experience. The company acquired Colombian brewer Bavaria in 2005 in order to strengthen its position in the dynamic Latin American market. In addition to attaining a near-monopoly (the company had a 98% share of beer volumes in 2006 according to Euromonitor International), SABMiller has found Colombia to be a more valuable market than expected. In fact, Colombia is now one of the most profitable territories in the company's portfolio after South Africa.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, SABMiller has consolidated its position as the most important alcoholic drinks company in Colombia and developed its position through a two-pronged strategy. On the one hand, the company has looked to increase consumption among beer drinkers while also looking for ways to broaden its consumer base. In addition to introducing more efficient distribution methods, the company has increased the penetration of refrigeration in the vast number of small family-run operations. SABMiller has also revamped its brand portfolio and embarked on marketing campaigns to target higher-income consumers (who traditionally stigmatised beer drinking) as well as non-traditional beer drinkers (particularly women). One challenge facing all brewers in Colombia is how to attract female consumers. Historically, beer has been the preserve of men, consumed in downmarket male-dominated pubs with marketing typically consisting of posters featuring women in skimpy bikinis – a sure-fire way to alienate 52% of the legal drinking age population.</p>
<p>SABMiller has invested significant resources in changing the brand image of Club Colombia, Poker, Pilsen and Costeñita, as part of the overall strategy to reorganise its portfolio and reposition its products as premium alcoholic drinks. This strategy is also aimed at increasing the appeal of its products to younger consumers that prefer other alcoholic (particularly long drinks) and non-alcoholic drinks to beer. It appears the company has been successful in its quest to develop the beer category and take market share away from spirits and other alcoholic beverages. According to Euromonitor International, between 2002 and 2007, beer volumes grew by 9% (673 million litres), while spirits volumes were down by 1% (7 million litres). </p>
<p>Additionally, recognising the importance of attracting female consumers, SABMiller launched Redd's, a malt-based RTD, in Colombia in late 2007. Designed to appeal to women, Redd's features a lighter flavour than beer and is sold in packs of 5 or 10 bottles, rather than the heavier 6, 12 or 24 packs sold to men. Moreover, the 5 and 10 packs are shaped like a woman's handbag. The company appears to be following a strategy previously used in the Russian market where the Redd's brand is also specifically targeted at young women. </p>
<p>Not willing to rest on its laurels, SABMiller has apparently been following the privatisation process of local spirits companies in Colombia. According to reports, the company has been in talks with state-owned Industria Licorera de Caldas, the second largest spirits manufacturer in Colombia with a 15% share of spirits volumes in 2006 according to Euromonitor International. The state-owned company produces a renowned rum, Ron Viejo De Caldas. Whilst rum suffers from an old-fashioned image and is perceived as being too traditional for younger consumers in many South American countries, including Colombia, SABMiller may be looking to revamp the brand, in much the same way as the traditional beer products in the Bavaria portfolio have been repositioned. </p>
<h3>Other multinationals enter the fray</h3>
<p>SABMiller is not the only multinational brewer to recognise the potential of the Colombian market. With imported beers enjoying a surge in popularity, Anheuser-Busch launched Budweiser beer in the Colombian market in February 2006, followed by Bud Light in early 2007. As SABMiller's Aguila Light (which accounts for 3% of the market by total volume according to Euromonitor International) is the only other light beer available in Colombia, Anheuser-Busch's strategy of targeting an underdeveloped category might well help the company to carve a niche for itself in the SABMiller-dominated market. Companies hoping to gain a foothold in the Colombian market would do well to follow this lead. Although sales of stout, dark beer, low- and non-alcohol beers are miniscule in Colombia, these are categories in which SABMiller is not active. </p>
<p>However, given the sheer dominance of SABMiller, recent activities to boost sales and the possibility that the company will enter new categories such as spirits, it is difficult to see how any competitor could successfully challenge the giant's position. Even InBev, the market leader in Latin American beer (with a 34% share of total volume sales) due to its strength in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay, is unlikely to take on SABMiller in the Colombian market. </p>

Opportunities for multinationals in Ukraine’s beer market,"Multinational brewers are turning their attention to Ukraine. With the exception of Obolon, which is privately owned, multinationals dominate the market having swallowed up large Ukrainian breweries. InBev, Obolon, Carlsberg and SABMiller collectively hold around 95% of total volumes in this dynamic market, according to Euromonitor International.","<p>Multinational brewers are turning their attention to Ukraine. With the exception of Obolon, which is privately owned, multinationals dominate the market having swallowed up large Ukrainian breweries. InBev, Obolon, Carlsberg and SABMiller collectively hold around 95% of total volumes in this dynamic market, according to Euromonitor International.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Not only is Ukraine one of the largest markets for beer in Eastern Europe (behind Russia and Poland), it is also among the most dynamic. Continued economic growth and the associated rise in spending power have had a positive impact on beer sales, with total volumes up by 93% between 2002 and 2007. Additionally, with per capita consumption of only 58 litres in 2007 (compared to 71 litres in Russia, 92 litres in Romania and 163 litres in the Czech Republic) the Ukrainian market still offers a great deal of undeveloped potential. </p>
<p>The strong growth of standard and premium beer, particularly among international brands (eg Carlsberg, Foster's), is indicative of consumer interest in foreign brands, especially if they are produced locally and sold at local prices. These categories are expected to see further growth, with both Carlsberg and SABMiller deepening their interest in Ukraine in the first half of 2008.</p>
<h3>Carlsberg takes control of BBH and SABMiller acquires Sarmat</h3>
<p>As a result of its joint bid with Heineken for Scottish & Newcastle, Carlsberg took full control of BBH earlier this year. In addition to strengthening Carlsberg's position in the Russian market, this highly-prized acquisition puts Carlsberg in third position in the Ukrainian beer market behind InBev and Obolon. The company is expected to continue to invest in the Ukrainian market, with reports suggesting that it will build a new brewery to add capacity to its existing three breweries. </p>
<p>With the Ukrainian market becoming increasingly competitive, the construction of a new brewery may be necessary to help Carlsberg strengthen its position. In May 2008 SABMiller acquired Sarmat, the fourth biggest player in the market. Although both Carlsberg and SABMiller have set their sights on increasing share in the Ukrainian market, it is unlikely that either player will topple InBev as the market leader in the mid term. That said, definite opportunities exist for all three multinational giants with volume sales of beer in Ukraine likely to increase by 36% over 2007-2012 to reach 3,641 million litres. Growth will be driven by the continued shift among consumers towards drinks with a low-alcohol content and the developing culture of beer consumption. Rising consumer incomes will also be of importance, fuelling value sales and getting premium beer off the ground. </p>

“InBusch” – new global giant means further consolidation for the beer industry,"Anheuser-Busch's acceptance of InBev's takeover offer has further strengthened InBev's position as the world's leading brewer. Excluding equity stakes in other brewers, the enlarged InBev, based on 2007 volume sales, will command over 21% of global beer volumes and will be nearly twice the size of second-ranked SABMiller. The deal, following the takeover of Scottish & Newcastle, will further consolidate global beer sales among a small number of brewers.","<p>Anheuser-Busch's acceptance of InBev's takeover offer has further strengthened InBev's position as the world's leading brewer. Excluding equity stakes in other brewers, the enlarged InBev, based on 2007 volume sales, will command over 21% of global beer volumes and will be nearly twice the size of second-ranked SABMiller. The deal, following the takeover of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, will further consolidate global beer sales among a small number of brewers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Equity stakes make “InBusch” even stronger</h3>
<p>If one were also to include equity stakes, InBev's position would be even stronger. Including Anheuser-Busch's equity stakes in Modelo and Tsingtao, the newly-formed company will account for 24% of global volumes, twice that of second-placed SABMiller with a 12% share of the market.</p>
<p>The equity stakes in Modelo (50%) and Tsingtao (27%) will be a new challenge for InBev as the Belgian-based company has tended to make outright acquisitions rather than buy minority stakes.</p>
<p>The equity stake in Modelo is already causing difficulties for the proposed takeover. Modelo has already reserved the right to be allowed to give its consent to the deal. Whether the company can do anything to prevent the deal is apparently unlikely, and it could well be a negotiating tactic to get better terms from the beer giant with regard to operational control.</p>
<p>In the short term InBev is unlikely to have the resources to acquire majority stakes in these two companies, even if it were possible. InBev is also unlikely to sell these stakes as they provide the company with access to large and growing markets. At some point in the future, however, it would welcome the opportunity to acquire majority stakes in these companies should their current owners decide to sell. Equally importantly, it would not want them falling into the hands of its rivals. </p>
<h3>Big five take bigger share</h3>
<p>This deal, following the Scottish & Newcastle acquisition, will further consolidate the market among the top five suppliers. Based on 2007 figures, the top five brewers will account for a 47% share of sales, excluding equity stakes, up from 27% in 2000.</p>
<p>This consolidation is likely to continue. Major targets are likely to include large regional players such as Molson Coors, Empresas Polar, FEMSA and possibly even Diageo's beer arm. However, this is unlikely to happen for a while as most of the leading five brewers look to improve their balance sheets and integrate their new acquisitions. Any short-term acquisitions are likely to be smaller national players, filling gaps in regional portfolios. However, barring a dramatic fall in sales for the enlarged InBev, this will not affect its position as the world's number one brewer for the foreseeable future. </p>

Can beer weather the economic storm?,"Although the gloomy economic climate is resulting in consumers cutting back on discretionary spending, alcoholic drinks are considered an affordable luxury by most income groups. Not only does this make alcoholic drinks somewhat recession-proof, it also creates strategic opportunities for manufacturers in times of economic uncertainty. ","<p>Although the gloomy economic climate is resulting in consumers cutting back on discretionary spending, alcoholic drinks are considered an affordable luxury by most income groups. Not only does this make alcoholic drinks somewhat recession-proof, it also creates strategic opportunities for manufacturers in times of economic uncertainty. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Despite the somewhat 'recession-proof' nature of alcoholic drinks, rising commodity prices are having a knock-on effect on retail prices of beer as manufacturers struggle to absorb higher costs of ingredients, packaging and transportation. In Japan, brewers Asahi, Kirin and Sapporo (which account for over 80% of beer sales in the country by volume) have all raised retail prices this year on the back of higher malt and packaging costs. For Asahi, this represented the first price hike (with the exception of tax increases) in 18 years. Furthermore, the three competitors have agreed to synchronise their aluminium can requirements, and jointly purchase cardboard packaging in order to reduce costs. The situation is by no means unique to the Japanese market; in countries as diverse as the Czech Republic and China brewers have announced price rises in the region of 4-6% to offset soaring costs of materials. </p>
<h3>Economy brands and private label lines stand to benefit</h3>
<p>Given these rising costs and diminishing disposable income, Euromonitor International expects to see a shift towards cheaper beers, including economy brands and private label lines. Economy lager is forecast to outperform both standard and premium variants on a global level (economy lager volumes are set to grow by a 4% CAGR between 2007 and 2012, 1% ahead of lager as a whole). This type of trading down from premium and standard to economy brands was prevalent during the recent recession in Germany, where the price of economy lager in the off-trade is sometimes up to three times cheaper than premium lager (between 2002 and 2007 volume sales of premium and standard lager declined by a 3% CAGR while economy lager posted a CAGR of 6%). One upshot is that drinking economy beer, such as Oettinger, has come to be regarded as cool among many younger consumers in Germany. </p>
<h3>Beer stands to gain share from spirits and wine</h3>
<p>As well as trading down from more expensive beer brands to cheaper ones, consumers may well also switch from more expensive alcoholic drinks such as spirits and wine to beer, which tends to be cheaper. While it is likely that the on-trade will feel the effects of the economic downturn more strongly as people will go out less frequently and spend less in bars and restaurants, the off-trade will also be impacted. </p>
<p>Because alcoholic drinks are offered at much lower prices in off-trade channels compared to on-trade channels, consumers will probably go out less and socialise more at home, thus creating opportunities for the off-trade. However, even in the off-trade consumers will still be looking to reign in their spending, choosing beer over more expensive wine and spirits. On the other hand, opportunities exist for premium brands as a status-boosting symbol.</p>
<h3>Key opportunities</h3>
<p>Despite the current economic climate, clear opportunities exist in the global beer market:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Economy brands offering value for money stand to gain share from standard and premium variants although some degree of polarisation is expected with certain consumers opting for premium brands as an outward display of status;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Brewers may look to reformulate or repackage existing brands as they seek to control costs and minimise price hikes;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Private label lines targeting price-conscious consumers are well-placed for future growth;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The off-trade is expected to outperform the on-trade as consumers opt to socialise at home rather than go out. Specifically, sales through discounters are expected to see strong growth as cash-strapped consumers seek out bargains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Euromonitor International expects Vietnam and Thailand to be among the key opportunity markets for economy beer over the next five years. This highlights the fact that the BRICs and other emerging markets are expected to be pillars of strength during the economic slowdown as they are being sustained through their own economic growth as a result of growing middle-class wealth. Although rising inflation is a concern in these countries, middle-to-high income consumers have a higher threshold to rising costs and invariably will be prepared to spend beyond their means to maintain their aspirant lifestyle.</p>
<p>Despite increasing pressure on disposable income within developed economies, consumers will not (and have not historically) stop drinking. Relative to their other everyday costs alcohol is deemed an affordable luxury. Cash-strapped consumers will seek out cheaper options and beer in particular stands to benefit from this trading down.</p>

Brewers target women with wheat beer offerings,"Rising consumer interest in speciality beers presents definite opportunities for the dark beer category. Savvy brewers are working to position wheat beer as a high-quality, premium beer with a milder and sweeter taste, well suited to luring non-beer drinking female consumers.","<p>Rising consumer interest in speciality beers presents definite opportunities for the dark beer category. Savvy brewers are working to position wheat beer as a high-quality, premium beer with a milder and sweeter taste, well suited to luring non-beer drinking female consumers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The development of wheat beers targeted at women is expected to inject some excitement into a lacklustre category. Dark beer volumes have been largely stagnant (1% average annual growth between 2002 and 2007), as the category suffers from an old-fashioned image and the dissipation of its key (ageing) consumer base in traditional Western European markets. Elsewhere dark beer is more of a niche product, generally considered to be an acquired taste, which has limited its appeal in new markets. However, the lighter flavour of wheat beer makes it an accessible beer for women and this demographic offers significant opportunity for brewers looking to generate value growth. Since female consumers tend to be more brand- and fashion-conscious and less tied to traditional consumption patterns than their male counterparts, they also tend to be more responsive to manufacturers' product innovation and marketing activity.</p>
<p>In many Western European markets, beer sales have been driven by premium products, which meet consumer demand for high-quality and flavourful beers. This trend has positively impacted dark beer; although global volumes have been largely stagnant, the sector outperformed the overall beer market in terms of value growth according to Euromonitor International as consumers opted for high-quality and flavourful beers.</p>
<p>In the key German market which accounts for 25% of global dark beer volumes, the category has seen a renaissance driven by Weissbier (wheat beer) and Kölsch, a dark beer variety from the Rhine region. The demographic influence of the ageing population has a strong impact on the beer sector in Germany as older people tend to drink less alcohol and the middle-aged segment of traditional beer drinkers is diminishing. As a result, growth in beer can only come from younger and increasingly female consumers. These consumer groups are turning away from the traditionally tart beer consumed by their parents and grandparents, Pilsener, which accounts for over 60% of all beer volumes sold in Germany, and looking for different tastes elsewhere. It is not surprising that a generation brought up on fizzy drinks and Nutella is turning to sweeter and milder tastes. Weissbier (wheat beer) and Kölsch offer a milder taste and increasingly appeal to younger and female consumers.</p>
<p>Brewers in the Netherlands and Belgium have taken a more direct approach to attracting female drinkers. The success of rosé wine has spawned pink-coloured, fruit-flavoured extensions of popular wheat beer brands designed to tempt female wine drinkers to drink beer instead. Heineken spearheaded the trend with Wieckse Rosé beer, which was launched in the on-trade in the Netherlands in 2006. Euromonitor International expects that rosé beer will continue to attract new consumers and grow the wheat beer category over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In the US, wheat beer was the best performing type of beer in 2007 for the fourth year in a row, with volume sales up by 12% according to Euromonitor International. The beer style's success has been driven by its crisp fruity flavour, which appeals to alcohol consumers who are used to light American lagers, or do not normally like the taste of beer. Additionally, the complex flavour profile and generally high-alcohol content appeal to craft beer enthusiasts. The potential to lure non-beer drinkers and beer aficionados alike has attracted the major brewers, and the top three brands Blue Moon, Widmer Hefeweizen and Leninekugel Weiss have ties to the 'Big Three' (Anheuser-Busch, SABMiller and Molson Coors). </p>
<p>In contrast to the US and Germany where dark beer is experiencing a revival, in the UK volumes declined by an annual average of 3% between 2002 and 2007, reflecting the general trend in the UK beer market as consumers lose interest in drinking beer. Faced with declining beer sales in the UK, brewers are looking for ways to tap into the female demographic. Following the success of its Blue Moon wheat beer in the US, Molson Coors is now launching the brand in the UK, targeting women with touches like serving it with an orange slice to accentuate its fruity taste. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International expects that brewers will continue to invest in wheat beer over the mid to long term as this category provides interesting opportunities to offer upmarket products which target female consumers. Not only does the popularity of wheat beer follow a broad trend towards interest in unusual, high-quality and complex beers, it is well-suited to female drinkers as unlike most dark beers it is less bitter than traditional lagers and beers, which means it appeals to more reluctant beer drinkers. Additionally, many wheat beers, particularly the Belgian variety, are also lower in alcohol than other premium beers, which is a bonus at a time when harsher drink-driving laws and growing health concerns are encouraging consumers to restrict their alcohol intake. Marketers can, therefore, present wheat beer as an aspirational and exclusive product for educated drinkers. </p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The UK-based company has appointed NM Rothschild as its adviser, with the private company thought to be worth £200 million.</p>
<p>Started in the UK in 1989 and until a short time ago only seen in Indian restaurants in the country, the brand has licensed production, gained bar and supermarket listings, expanded its product range to tap into trends and gained export volumes in recent times. The brand has bucked the recent declining trend in the UK beer market and posted growth, but its presence in the Indian market is the company's biggest asset.</p>
<h2>Indian market is key element for acquisition</h2>
<p>The Indian market is dominated by United Breweries and SABMiller which had a combined 2007 market share of 80%. Cobra's market share in the country is only just over 2% but has increased from near zero in 2005 to show dramatic growth. Cobra recently purchased its first brewery which is located in India; all other global production is licensed out. With low but increasing per capita consumption rising from 0.6 litres in 2000 to 1 litre in 2007, there is a major opportunity for beer in India and Cobra is well placed to exploit this.</p>
<p>Most of the major brewers or their associated companies would have at least a passing interest in Cobra due to its activities in the dynamic Indian market. Cost savings could be made with licensed production being brought in house along with packaging and distribution operations which are also currently outsourced. SABMiller could be particularly interested as it would increase its market share and production in India, closing the gap on United Breweries. The Cobra brand would also give SABMiller a niche brand which it could operate with its other premium brands along the same lines as Peroni Nastro Azzurro at a global level. SABMiller's lack of production facilities in the UK, however, would limit cost synergies but spare production capacity in the Netherlands, Italy or Eastern Europe could be utilised for its import-only UK operation. United Breweries may also be a potential bidder with the owner Dr Vijay Mallya recently declaring an interest.</p>
<h2>Cobra does offer future promise</h2>
<p>Cobra Beer has yet to make a profit but had sales last year of around £55 million. It has recently raised £15 million but has financed most of its expansion through debt. In the current financial climate this could put downward pressure on the company's valuation depending on current debt levels and repayment terms. Lord Bilimoria owns about two-thirds of the company, with the remainder held by private equity and company employees. It has recently launched a £14 million marketing campaign to promote itself in the UK market to compete against other world beers like Peroni, San Miguel and others.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International feels that this is an interesting company that has the potential to become a much bigger brand if the right partner or buyer is found. Its recent success in the Indian market will attract several interested parties both from within the alcoholic drinks industry and outside it in the form of private equity companies.</p>

UK on-trade beer sales facing the abyss,"The deteriorating economic environment, changing consumer habits, mounting legislative barriers and rising costs during the first half of 2008 all conspired against established on-trade UK beer consumption, although the industry is fighting back.","<p>The deteriorating economic environment, changing consumer habits, mounting legislative barriers and rising costs during the first half of 2008 all conspired against established on-trade UK beer consumption, although the industry is fighting back.</p>

<h3>A dismal year</h3>
<p>The still fluid market conditions are translating into a widening circle of redundancies, unprecedented numbers of pub closures, the lowest beer sales since the 1930s as well as an expected wave of additional taxes which could well be the final straw for beer sales in an already ailing on-trade channel. The UK Quarterly Beer Barometer, a comprehensive guide to beer trends in Britain, published by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), shows that 2.2 million fewer pints were drunk every day in the final quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter in 2007.</p>
<p>Soaring production and commodity costs during the first half of 2008 outlined a gloomy direction for on-trade beer sales. The environment deteriorated even further later in the year due to the poor weather during the summer months and the worsening economic climate. Added to this, the failure of England, Wales and Scotland to reach the European Football Championships kept people away from the pubs, which were already reeling from the smoking ban and competition from the off-trade. According to Euromonitor International, on-trade beer volume sales declined by 8.4% in 2008 compared to off-trade growth of 0.6% in the same year. Dark beer and stout in particular saw strong volume declines of 10%, while low/non-alcohol beer was the only category to maintain double-digit growth in 2008. </p>
<h3>Pubs and brewers feeling the pinch </h3>
<p>According to the BBPA closures in the UK are currently edging towards an average of six per day. The latest  figures from the trade body show that nearly 2,000 pubs closed their doors for good in 2008, up from 1,400 in 2007. The number of pub closures is accelerating as the economic climate deteriorates and people are going out less frequently. Punch Taverns, the UK's largest pub owner, said that it planned to cut up to 100 jobs as heavy discounting to prop up sales hit profits at Punch's leased pubs, with earnings down 12% compared to the previous financial year. Furthermore, the Royal Bank of Scotland is looking to sell off its 1,000-strong pub network in an attempt to limit further financial losses by exiting the shrinking on-trade beer market. According to the BBPA, beer sales in pubs, bars and restaurants were down 9.9% on the same quarter in 2007 – equating to 1.4 million fewer pints every day. In total, 130 million fewer pints were sold in the on-trade during October to December 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Among the brewers, Scottish & Newcastle UK and InBev UK, controlled by Heineken and Anheuser-Busch InBev respectively, announced in January 2009 that they are also planning job cuts.</p>
<h3>Legislative barriers and changing lifestyles </h3>
<p>Intensifying efforts for additional governmental controls are underlining a shift in public opinion towards a stricter regulatory environment. The government has until now tried to shift the implementation of potentially unpopular laws onto local councils. However, in 2008, the Public Health Minister for England, Dawn Primarolo, warned the drinks industry to act more responsibly or face new laws governing alcohol sales. Proposed legislation includes curbs being introduced on happy hours, bars and pubs being forced to serve drinks in smaller glasses as well as larger ones, checkout displays in shops and strict enforcement of the voluntary labelling code to show how many units each drink contains. Chancellor Alistair Darling's announcement of an 8% duty tax rise in his pre-Budget report in November 2008 follows a previous duty rise earlier in the year, hence painting an even bleaker picture for the future of the industry. </p>
<p>Changing consumer lifestyles are also taking the fizz out of on-trade beer sales. Beer has gained an image problem among consumers due to the perception that it is less healthy than other alcoholic drinks and will lead to greater weight gain, making the drink less appealing at a time when people are increasingly image-conscious. The growth of food sales in pubs has also changed drinking habits. The rise of the gastro pub, partly driven by a fall in alcohol volume sales and tighter drink-driving laws, means that more consumers are likely to choose wine. </p>
<h3>The industry fights back</h3>
<p>Not taking this lying down, manufacturers as well as chained and independent pubs are mobilising on all fronts. The BBPA has joined forces  with other drinks trade bodies to call for a duty tax freeze on alcohol. The groups said that they would present a joint submission to the Treasury, asking the Chancellor to abandon plans to introduce a four year ""tax escalator"" on alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, special discounts are expected to intensify in order to maintain consumption levels in the face of one of the gloomiest years for the UK economy in decades. JD Wetherspoon's recent decision to offer its Greene King beer at £0.99 per pint might have faced criticism from the brewer, although it appears to be the only way forward in the face of the challenging economy and plummeting consumer confidence. </p>
<p>In other moves, Diageo announced a partnership with UK sausage supplier Debbie & Andrew's to manufacture products infused with Guinness in another attempt to tap into the gastro pub segment. Carlsberg UK has formed a partnership with County Estate Management Pubs and Country Choice to offer an entry-level food concept as part of the 'Savour It' brand, again in an effort to assist the ailing on-trade sector.</p>
<h3>Looking for the silver lining </h3>
<p>Although the situation looks pretty dire, manufacturers will need to grasp any opportunity that presents itself. Changing consumer lifestyles might well hold the key to overcoming the industry's current troubles.</p>
<p> Focusing on promoting the dynamic low/non-alcohol beer segment would thus provide an ideal opportunity to win the ongoing battle on two fronts - reassuring health-conscious consumers as well as responding to government and pressure group demands for a self-regulated industry. A forecast on-trade volume increase of 24.5% for 2008-2013 for this category is a very important opportunity not to be missed. The forecasted strong growth rates for low/non-alcohol beer will although not be a panacea due to the relatively small size of the segment within the beer market. We should hence also expect more radical plans to support the ailing on-trade as long as recessionary pressures continue mounting throughout 2009.  </p>

Low/non-alcohol beer under the spotlight,"Low/non-alcohol beer accounted for sales of some 29.5 million hectolitres in 2008, a figure seemingly dwarfed by total beer volume sales of 1,846 million hectolitres. Nevertheless, stringent legislative initiatives, health concerns and religious issues are all providing a significant boost to the category. ","<p>Low/non-alcohol beer accounted for sales of some 29.5 million hectolitres in 2008, a figure seemingly dwarfed by total beer volume sales of 1,846 million hectolitres. Nevertheless, stringent legislative initiatives, health concerns and religious issues are all providing a significant boost to the category. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>A closer inspection of the leading countries in terms of per capita consumption can prove revealing with regard to these factors.</p>
<h3>Legislative issues and health concerns </h3>
<p>Spain, with a per capita consumption of 15.2 litres, has emerged as the leader in the global rankings for low/non-alcohol beer. Stricter drink-driving legislation, increasing health awareness and a mature beer sector in need of innovation are the main growth drivers of the category. What started as a niche in Spain now accounts for around a 20% share of total beer volumes, and the success of new product launches such as Cruzcampo Light from Heineken España is further evidence of the category's potential. </p>
<p>Germany is another innovation- thirsty, mature beer market. With per capita consumption standing at 3.5 litres and rising, the health and wellness aspects of low/non-alcohol variants are increasingly coming into focus. Leading manufacturers of so-called “alkoholfreie biere” (low- alcohol variants according to Euromonitor International definitions) have re-launched their products with no alcohol content at all and stressed the wellness aspects of beers with natural B vitamins, magnesium and essential amino acids. Furthermore, ageing consumers tend to drink less alcohol and the middle-aged segment of traditional beer drinkers is diminishing, providing space for experimentation with alternatives for the younger generation of beer drinkers. </p>
<p>Although it still remains a small niche, accounting for only 1% of sales, low/non-alcohol beer in Italy is currently spearheading overall sector growth, registering a 15% volume CAGR over 2003-2008. Government authorities are investing heavily in campaigns to stress the category's advantages in the face of the country's drink-driving culture. Manufacturers are hence including non/low-alcohol beers in their ranges and are supporting them with elaborate advertising initiatives. Examples include Moretti Zero and a new non-alcoholic beer from Carlsberg Italia under the Swiss Feldschlösschen umbrella brand. </p>
<p>Lithuania comes third in the global rankings with per capita consumption of seven litres. Rising health concerns in the context of westernisation trends, along with advertising restrictions, have provided a boost to the category. Furthermore, an increase in the excise duty on high ABV alcoholic drinks has proved to be a key growth driver. A zero tolerance policy with regard to alcohol for the first two years after passing one's driving test, implemented in January 2008, has paved the way for the introduction of the category to a new generation of young consumers. </p>
<h3>Religious barriers and opportunities </h3>
<p>The United Arab Emirates can be used as an influential case study for the entire Middle East region. With no alcohol sales allowed to Muslim residents, expatriates are only allowed to purchase alcohol through luxury hotels, while a special licence is required to buy from a liquor store. Moreover, no advertising of alcoholic drinks is allowed due to religious constraints. In this context, non-alcoholic beer, which constitutes the vast majority of sales within the low/non-alcohol category, is riding the westernisation bandwagon while overcoming religious barriers. With per capita consumption standing at 4.4 litres and rising, there is still room for impressive growth in the country. </p>
<p>With Iran positioned at the conservative end of the religious spectrum, the fact that it features prominently in the top slots in terms of per capita consumption, size and growth of low/non-alcohol beer should come as no surprise. The category accounted for sales of 2.6 million hectolitres in 2008, and registered a 27.5% volume CAGR over the 2003-2008 period. Recent domestic media coverage of the alleged health benefits of non-alcoholic beer, along with government restrictions on the sales of cola carbonates, paint a very positive outlook for the category over the short and medium term.</p>
<h3>Low/non-alcohol fuelled optimism </h3>
<p>As growth rates for the majority of beer subsectors weaken, low/non-alcohol variants are emerging as potential growth drivers for the sector. </p>
<p>Although 2009 could be a difficult year, the long-term outlook is positive. Euromonitor International expects the low/non-alcohol beer category to grow by a 5% CAGR in volume terms over the next five years. The category will face mounting competition from non-alcoholic drinks for share of throat, although stressing the flavour aspect along with the health benefits will assist in retaining consumers. Potentially stricter drink-driving laws, such as a proposal to slash the drink-driving limit in Scotland from 80mg/100ml to 50mg in December 2008, will further stimulate growth. </p>
<p>Manufacturers such as Heineken NV and Anadolu Efes are expected to take advantage of their established and loyal consumer base in the Middle East region, hence securing strong growth rates on the back of westernisation trends and the lack of alternatives. </p>

At the World Barley, Malt &amp; Beer Conference, which will take place on 25- 27 March in Berlin, Germany, Head of Global Alcoholic Drinks Research, Marlous Kuiper, will discuss key drivers in the global beer market, focusing on the BRIC markets and looking at the impact of the current economic climate on the beer industry. Below is a summary of issues affecting the global beer market.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Major trends in the global beer market</h3>
<p>In 2008 some 185 billion litres of beer were sold globally. Between 2003 and 2008 global beer volumes grew at a CAGR of 4.6%, which was in line with value growth over the period, which stood at 4.9%, at fixed exchange rates. Over this period beer sales were driven by premiumisation, changing demographics, regulation and increasing consumer health-consciousness, which has been reflected in the new products launched in the beer category in recent years.</p>
<p>In all regions except Asia-Pacific, value growth outpaced volume growth as consumers generally drank similar volumes, but opted for better quality products. This trend is most pronounced in mature markets which are approaching saturation. For example, in Japan, Germany and the UK (which are among the 10 biggest volume markets for beer) volumes are actually declining while values continue to rise. In Asia-Pacific volume growth is being driven by the massive Chinese market, which accounted for 46% of actual global volume gains between 2003 and 2008.</p>
<h3>Lager the largest category </h3>
<p>Lager is by far the most important beer type, accounting for 94% of global beer sales by volume and 90% by value in 2008. Although sales remain miniscule compared to lager, low/non-alcohol beer is the star category in beer in terms of both volume and value growth. The sector is benefiting from the current drive to consume less alcohol and stricter drink-driving regulations in many countries.</p>
<p>Although dark beer suffers from an old-fashioned image in many traditional beer drinking countries, the sector has seen average growth in value terms driven by the popularity of wheat beer among younger consumers looking for sweeter and milder tastes.</p>
<p>Falling consumption of stout in key markets contributed to overall volume stagnation on a global level between 2003 and 2008.</p>
<h3>Emerging markets expected to be the most dynamic</h3>
<p>Global demand for beer is expected to grow over the next five years, albeit at a slower rate than that seen historically. Generally, emerging markets are expected to be more dynamic than developed markets over the next five years. With the global financial situation changing rapidly, Euromonitor International expects some softening of emerging markets in the near future. The severity and length of these downturns are hard to gauge at the current time, but Euromonitor International believes that emerging beer markets are well placed to perform well over the medium and long term and brewers should continue their operations in them for the long-term benefits that they will bring.</p>

","<p>Euromonitor International's new Global Briefing, entitled ''Beer - Opportunities in Niche Categories”, provides an in-depth analysis of the performance of the global beer market. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The briefing provides updated growth rates for the global beer market, and where appropriate and relevant drills down to a country level. As the effects of the global downturn continue to be felt, causing the IMF to change its forecasts on a regular basis, Euromonitor International's updated figures paint a picture of how beer is now expected to be affected in 2009 and 2010 following a change in consumer spending patterns.</p>
<p>In the short to medium term global beer volume growth will slow due to the global economic downturn, but contraction is not expected. Economy lager will enjoy the benefit of being largely present in the off-trade as well as being a cheaper alternative to standard variants, and thus is expected to benefit from consumers trading down.</p>
<p>Looking at the longer-term trends, which are expected to return in force following the downturn, the briefing offers a comprehensive picture of the beer market, highlighting the most dynamic categories and identifying geographical hot spots driving global growth and looks at where opportunities exist within the market.</p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Beer retains momentum </h3>
<p>Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Singapore continued to enjoy buoyant beer sales in 2008, although different segments spearheaded growth in each country. In Thailand and Vietnam domestic economy lager generated the strongest increases of 11% and 10% respectively on the previous year, benefiting from its affordable price and widespread distribution. At the same time, there was growing interest and competition within low-alcohol beer thanks to growing consumer health consciousness. Sales of premium lager, on the other hand, declined as aspirational consumption was one of the first victims of the ongoing recession. Conversely, Baltika Breweries, the Russian subsidiary of Carlsberg, began exporting the premium Baltika 7 brand to Vietnam in March 2009 in a move that demonstrates optimism for the medium and long-term potential of the premium segment in the region. Moreover, the integration of Vietnam into the WTO is opening up more opportunities for investment and imports from foreign companies, especially as Vietnam's government is committed to reducing tax levies on imported beer to 65% after joining the WTO and further reducing the rate to 35% in the next five years. </p>
<p>Aside from making up 90% of total beer volumes, domestic standard lager was the fastest growing beer segment in the Philippines over the review period, registering 5% volume growth in 2008. The cementing of a brand-loyal consumer base by leader San Miguel Pale Pilsen, which has a huge mass-market appeal, was the primary growth driver for the segment, while the prominent positioning of the beer category within Filipino drinking culture has – for the moment – limited the trading down trend.</p>
<p>Singapore has jumped on the craft beer bandwagon, which has almost single-handedly defied the gloomy environment in mature markets such as the UK and the US. The rise in number of microbreweries, with Red Dot Brewhouse being the latest addition in 2008, has aided the growth of domestic beer brands. The wide range of specially crafted beers offered by these microbreweries saw them enjoy great popularity among consumers in 2008, while advanced promotional techniques such as food offerings complete the picture of a beer market that is becoming increasingly westernised. Greater knowledge about premium brands was also a key contributory factor to premium lager's performance in 2008 as consumers became more willing to experiment.</p>
<h3>New World variants dominate</h3>
<p>The perceived health attributes of wine along with still developing westernisation trends are the common drivers behind strong growth rates in the majority of Asian-Pacific markets. Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore have all embraced accessible and affordable entry-level New World variants. Wine varietals originating from Australia, New Zealand, and increasingly Chile and Argentina, have made significant inroads in the region. Within this context, Thailand witnessed total volume growth of 7% in 2008, higher than the review period CAGR, while the Philippines saw total volume sales increase by 8% to reach almost 11 million litres and Singapore's wine sales grew by 9% in volume terms to hit seven million litres.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Vietnam wine sales in the retail channel mostly originate from Old World countries such as France and Italy because of the major influence of French colonial history on the country and the well-established nature of these wine types in the market. Old World wines account for about 67% of still red wine sales, 60% of still white wine sales and 63% of still rosé wine sales. However, as import and export activities have been growing rapidly in Vietnam, this has led to increasing sales of New World variants. For example, New World wines saw their share of still white wine sales increase by half a percentage point in 2008 to almost 41%. Although New World wines were increasingly available in mass retail channels, this did not deter Old World still red and white wines from seeing a rise in sales during 2008. </p>
<h3>Slowing down but not declining</h3>
<p>Although the global financial crisis is indeed expected to have a comparatively less pronounced impact on Asia-Pacific, growth rates and consumption habits will inevitably be affected in the short term. More than other regions, Asian economies depend on inflows of foreign investment and participation. Any further deterioration in investor confidence will hit inflows of foreign investment hard and lead to substantial capital outflows.</p>
<p>Tourism, one of the major growth drivers in the region, will be among the casualties. In 2008 the number of tourists visiting the Philippines reached more than 3.4 million, while it surpassed 10 million in Singapore. The expected sharp drop in arrivals over 2009 will thus have a negative impact on sales of imported beer variants. Furthermore, the premium and standard beer segments will temporarily suffer throughout the region as manufacturers have not managed to establish loyal audiences. Nevertheless, total beer volumes will maintain their momentum, primarily fuelled by growth in the economy segment as consumers will trade down rather than stop consuming as beer consumption has become embedded in their drinking habits, a lesson learnt from previous crises.</p>
<p>On the wine front, the already dominant position of New World varietals in the majority of markets does not leave much room for trading down, except going back to cheap local home-brewed variants. The general lack of in-depth knowledge and education regarding provenance, quality credentials and brand will most probably translate into a temporary surge in the penetration levels of contraband. In countries within the region where mostly economy, locally-produced non-grape variants enjoy strong penetration levels and a historic presence, consumers are more likely to trade down to such products. On the other hand, the exceptional success of Old World wine in Vietnam clearly demonstrates the importance of consistent consumer education in order to retain audiences in times of crisis.  </p>

On the other hand, however, environmental concerns, cost-saving initiatives, convenience issues and novelty elements are the driving force behind packaging innovation, hence bringing PET, aluminium and mini-keg formats under the spotlight.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Glass formats retain dominant position </h3>
<p>Glass bottles retain their dominant position on a global level. China holds the leading slot in glass bottle usage by virtue of its large population and resulting large-scale consumption. On the other hand, volume consumption declines in Germany are proving detrimental to the use of glass bottles, while Russian and Canadian consumers' acceptance of metal beverage cans is having a cannibalisation effect on the penetration levels of glass. Russia also leads PET consumption within the beer industry with 47% of global unit volumes, with the bulk of PET bottles currently being sold primarily on the economy platform. In times of recession, consumers typically shift to economy brands. Nevertheless, historic lessons from previous recessions in Russia suggest that economy domestic beer tends to suffer as consumers in lower-income brackets halt purchases. Instead, premium domestic lagers tend to benefit as higher-income consumers reduce the frequency of eating out, but counterbalance this with an increase in at-home premium beer consumption. As a result, glass will not suffer to the same extent as PET from the expected temporary decline in consumption. At present, there are still only a few brands available in PET format, primarily limited to the domestic premium lager segment in Russia.</p>
<p>Conversely, manufacturers are reaffirming their support for the segment through new product launches such as Zlatopramen and Starobrno beer brands in 1.5-litre PET plastic bottles, introduced in May 2009 in the Czech Republic. Beer in PET bottles is also doing well in neighbouring Slovakia, where its market share is almost the same as for glass bottles. Glass manufacturers hence need to maintain the premium positioning of glass to avoid an even greater uptake of PET among brewers.</p>
<h3>Niche opportunities</h3>
<p>Aluminium bottles remain a niche packaging type for beer, used primarily for occasional promotional campaigns, such Estralla Damm's limited edition aluminium bottle for 2008. Aluminium bottles have also found use in the premium low-alcohol sector, as was the case with Icône Heineken. The aluminium bottle format is expected to witness strong forecast growth, but from a small base, to achieve a 0.5% share of total unit volumes in 2012.</p>
<p>Following a difficult start, beer draught systems and mini-kegs are beginning to benefit from a shift from on-premise to at-home consumption in Western Europe although they are still considered niche. Heineken's BeerTender and InBev's PerfectDraft systems using mini-kegs have been largely considered novelty products rather than functional packs and retail prices have initially put off part of their target audiences. Some beer producers are currently attempting to address price-sensitive consumers by offering a more competitive price. Grolsch launched “Cheersch” in 2008 at a lower price than most other home beer tap systems. Like Carlsberg's DraughtMaster, the new Grolsch draught system is to be used with a specially designed PET bottle, while its 2-litre format ensures frequency of renewal/purchase.</p>
<h3>Packaging innovation in recessionary times</h3>
<p>Despite the apparent unit volume growth of beer in glass, beverage cans and other packaging formats will continue to cannibalise share in both domestic and imported lager. Furthermore, glass bottles are increasingly facing strong competition from PET variants in the domestic lager segment due to their use in 1-2 litre sizes for economy variants. The use of glass bottles will remain prominent in imported beer due to the perception of it being a premium packaging type for this higher margin sector.</p>
<p>Innovation within the glass segment can also take many forms. The launch of Summer Draft beer in a non-symmetrical 'grip' bottle for the Brazilian market in 2009 by Femsa Cerveja Brasil clearly demonstrates that convenience can sometimes be based on a detail rather than a radical reformulation.</p>
<p>Metal formats can be expected to gain share in the off-trade channel as consumers will temporarily be forced to trade down to economy lines in metal beverage cans as the global financial crisis takes its toll. The growing acceptance of PET bottles in 330-500ml sizes for mid and premium lines is also starting to have an impact. For the moment, glass remains stronger in the on-trade due to less opportunity for other pack types to utilise innovative packaging for shelf impact. On the other hand, the further establishment of the cocooning trend could trigger a temporary decline in on-trade use of glass bottles as this format could shift its focus to the retail channel as consumers seek luxury and affordable indulgence at home.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Euromonitor International believes that a move to larger sizes and economy formats such as metal beverage cans should be considered certain, at least for the duration of the economic downturn as consumers seek to maximise value and minimise cost. Moreover, emphasis on lightweighting as a method to reduce material and transportation costs will gain renewed momentum following existing activities under 'green' initiatives. Anecdotal evidence that suggests lack of willingness to experiment and consumer hesitancy to purchase radically innovative products in economically challenging times will also lead to a significant slowdown in new packaging launches over the short term.</p>

Consolidation in beer hit by wider economic crisis,"The recent round of consolidation within the industry should slow in 2009 due to the global credit crunch. The methods in which funds have been arranged for acquisitions will be affected by the increased hesitancy of banks to lend and the general downturn in the stock market. Euromonitor International believes that acquisitions on the scale of Anheuser-Busch and Baltic Beverages Holding will not be seen over the short term, but consolidation will once again become a feature of the industry over","<p>The recent round of consolidation within the industry should slow in 2009 due to the global credit crunch. The methods in which funds have been arranged for acquisitions will be affected by the increased hesitancy of banks to lend and the general downturn in the stock market. Euromonitor International believes that acquisitions on the scale of Anheuser-Busch and Baltic Beverages Holding will not be seen over the short term, but consolidation will once again become a feature of the industry over the medium to long term.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>This does not mean that acquisitions will stop completely as the economic downturn could offer opportunities for those brewers that can afford to take risks. These could take the form of large multinational brewers taking stakes (either partial or complete) in regional and national brewers that are not performing well in the economic downturn. Major brewers are also not immune. Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) is rumoured to be making some divestments soon in order to finance the Anheuser-Busch acquisition, and other brewers could see divestment as a way to raise cash for other acquisitions or to maintain dividend payouts. </p>
<p>Brewers that can raise finance and are willing to take a risk on acquisitions in this economic downturn could find themselves with a better return on investment due to the lower acquisition cost of assets if brought in this period compared to when the economy strengthens.</p>
<h3>Joint ventures move into the spotlight</h3>
<p>In the last year new joint ventures have come into existence, namely the MillerCoors JV in the US and Heineken and Efes in Eastern Europe, and, on a smaller scale, Heineken and Diageo extending the existing Brandhouse venture and building a brewery in South Africa. Joint ventures allow companies to share the risks and rewards In cases where both partners already have operations in the region, cost synergies in terms of input prices, production, distribution and administrative and marketing costs may be apparent. </p>
<h3>Trading up trend will stall</h3>
<p>Euromonitor International believes that in the short term the trading up trend to premium brands will falter in countries that have been hit by the recent economic turmoil. This can be seen in the US where volumes of premium imported beers, such as Corona and Heineken, were reported to be weaker in Q3 2008 compared to Q3 2007 as consumers trade down to domestically produced standard and economy beers.</p>
<p>This trading down trend will obviously affect brewers that have positioned themselves at the top end of the price range more than brewers that have a wide brand offering across the price spectrum. This will affect operations like Heineken or Crown Imports in the US, which only offer imported beers mostly positioned at the top end of the market, rather than ABI, which has brands at several price points.</p>
<p>Opportunities exist within this trading down trend as it could see the rise of private label beer in countries like the UK where supermarkets command a large share of the off-trade channel and have the operational, distribution and marketing muscle to launch beers that are positioned on price. This could benefit smaller brewers using recently underused or spare capacity. Brewers may also extend their own brand ranges downward to provide the consumer with an assisted trade down whilst still trading on the reputation of the parent brand. The other option is that, in the short term, brewers lower their margins to bring down ultimate consumer cost, although this runs the risk, particularly in the premium and standard segments, of devaluing the brand over the long term.</p>
<h3>Anheuser-Busch InBev a global giant</h3>
<p>The biggest story of the year will continue to have repercussions for the entire industry for some time to come, and Euromonitor International believes that it will take some dramatic consolidation moves and some never-seen-before performances for the company to lose its status as number one global brewer by volume. To put it into context, SABMiller, the number two ranked brewer, would have to take over Heineken (ranked fourth), Molson Coors (ranked ninth) and acquire the 51% stake it does not own in China Resources to exceed ABI's 2007 volumes. The stake that Anheuser-Busch holds in Modelo will also act as a strategic obstacle to competitors if ABI decides to keep it.</p>
<p>The company that the acquisition may affect the most is Heineken. This is due to Heineken, and several of the companies in which it holds an interest, producing or distributing the Budweiser brand in their local markets. ABI has stated that it intends to take the Budweiser brand global, and with operations in most of the countries in which Heineken holds the licence, it would make sense if InBev took the brand back in-house, depending on the terms of the licensing agreements, thus damaging Heineken's revenues. With Heineken also present in the imported premium market in the US, it will also surely face a stronger push from ABI's formidable marketing and distribution muscle for brands such as Stella Artois, Beck's and others.</p>
<p>Over the next few years Euromonitor International predicts that ABI will look more closely at its operations, particularly in the US, and dispose of non-core operations rather than look for further expansion. The only exceptions Euromonitor International can foresee is if Foster's beer operations come up for sale, giving ABI a leading position in Australasia, or if Budejovicky Budvar comes up for sale, potentially uniting the two Bud brands and finally settling the century-old trademark conflict.</p>
<h3>Companies to watch </h3>
<h3>Carlsberg</h3>
<p>The acquisition of some of S&N's assets, most notably giving Carlsberg total control of Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH), will mean a doubling of volumes. Such a fundamental shift in pace would prove difficult for any company, but this will be mitigated by Carlsberg's knowledge of BBH's operations. What is probably most worrying at the current time for Carlsberg is the downturn in volume growth and the slower-than-hoped-for transition to higher-priced beer brands in Russia and other Eastern European countries. Carlsberg has deepened its exposure to the region with the complete acquisition of BBH and the slowdown should affect the company's volume forecasts for the region.</p>
<h3>MillerCoors</h3>
<p>This new venture between the second and third-ranked players in the US poses many questions, and both the brewers and their rivals will be keen to see how it develops. Could the combination of both companies' brands and reach in the world's largest beer value market turn the tide against a dominant market rival that has recently been acquired? Will the cost synergies, access to distributors and increased investment bring the returns expected, and could this be a model for other brewers to follow? Euromonitor International believes that the MillerCoors venture will be successful, but probably not that much more successful than had both companies continued separately. </p>
<h3>Cobra </h3>
<p>An up-for-sale sign currently hangs over the Cobra operations, predominantly a sales and marketing company for the Indian-themed Cobra brand. Most brewers would be eyeing up its operations in India, where in the past two years it has managed to achieve a near 2% market share and looks set to grow at levels that most brewers can only dream of. India is also home to the only brewery that Cobra owns. Its UK operation could be seen as secondary to this market, but may also be of interest as it sells huge volumes through the Indian restaurants that are present in every built-up area and has recently gained listings in several supermarkets, posting astonishing growth.</p>
<p>The company could be split into its Indian and UK operations (supposedly with exports to rest of the world), with separate buyers for each element. Cobra has made arrangements for the business to be split along those lines if a potential suitor is interested in just either the UK or Indian assets. A question hangs over Cobra's financial stability with the company reportedly never posting a profit. Volume increases were driven by high profile marketing campaigns and subsequent debt levels could be high at a time when credit is constrained and much more expensive.</p>
<h3>Brands to watch</h3>
<h3>Snow</h3>
<p>Bud Light was beaten into second place in the global beer brand rankings by volume in 2007 by China Resources' Snow brand. Posting strong growth in 2007, Snow reached the top spot through a combination of stellar growth in the Chinese economy lager market, extending the brand to differing price points, the acquisition of breweries in regions of China in which the company had not previously had operations and marketing activities. Comparing this brand to its major Chinese rival Tsingtao shows what a stellar performance it posted in CAGR terms over 2003-2007. Snow posted a 58% CAGR compared to Tsingtao's 16% in terms of absolute volumes, gaining 4,302 million litres per year between 2003-2007 (the highest of any brand) to Tsingtao's 1,036 million litres (the second highest increase). </p>
<h3>Budweiser </h3>
<p>The acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev has given them the Budweiser and Bud Light brands, respectively the second and third leading brands globally by volume. Both of these brands have been massively successful in North America but have sold relatively lower volumes outside the region, except in China, Ireland and the UK. </p>
<p>The brand's advertising has been well received historically and consumers all over the world recognise the brand. Anheuser-Busch has had trouble expanding volumes of the brand outside English-speaking markets, except China, where it has a production presence, mostly relying on licensing agreements with partners, particularly Heineken. The wider geographical spread of production, marketing assets, distribution and market share enjoyed by InBev should help the brand become a success outside its traditionally strong markets. Expect Budweiser to become more accessible to consumers in InBev's Latin American strongholds first, before being rolled out in Western and Eastern Europe, branded as Budweiser or another name, depending on where the Budweiser brand name can legally be used.</p>

On the other hand, improved product formulation, changing consumption habits and niche targeting have paved the way for the category to witness impressive, double- digit growth in the midst of one of the most challenging times for the UK beer industry. Bearing in mind that the low/non-alcohol beer segment accounts for merely 0.6% of total beer sales in the country, Euromonitor International believes that the category's growth prospects could indeed prove to be intoxicating.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>State of a beer-drinking nation </h3>
<p>Overall beer sales in the UK were on a steadily negative trajectory over 2003-2008, witnessing a volume CAGR decline of 2%, and the trend appears to be further accelerating. The on-trade has been particularly hit and the still fluid market conditions are translating into a widening circle of redundancies, unprecedented numbers of pub closures and the lowest beer sales since the 1930s. With wine and soft drinks increasing their share of throat, soaring production and commodity costs during the first half of 2008 outlined a gloomy direction for beer sales. The environment deteriorated even further later in the year due to the poor weather over the summer months and the worsening economic climate. Added to this, the failure of England, Wales and Scotland to reach the European Football Championships kept people away from the pubs, which were already reeling from the smoking ban and competition from the off-trade. According to Euromonitor International, overall beer volume sales in the UK declined by 4.8% in 2008, with dominant on-trade categories dark beer and stout in particular seeing strong volume declines of 7.5% and 9.6% respectively, while low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer were two of the few categories to maintain double-digit growth, registering 28% and 9.8% volume increases respectively. </p>
<p>On the other hand, UK beer drinkers pay more than nine times the rate of duty tax as German consumers and seven times as much as the French, according to research commissioned by the British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA). Furthermore, initiatives for more stringent drink- driving legislation, the introduction of a mandatory code on selling alcohol, including a clampdown on promotions and a suggestion for implementing minimum pricing for alcoholic drinks, are painting a bleak picture for the industry which is currently being forced onto the defensive. </p>
<h3>Low/non-alcohol beer offers potential</h3>
<p>Low/non-alcohol beer variants are hence surfacing as a primary growth driver for the battered and largely vilified UK beer market. Appealing to drivers, health-conscious consumers and individuals who cannot consume alcohol for medical or religious reasons, non/low-alcohol variants are also the industry's answer to government views regarding the alleged strain of alcohol abuse on Britain. The Health and Safety Commission claims that alcohol accounts for 8-14 million lost working days each year, and the Home Office claims that alcohol abuse costs the NHS around £1.6 billion a year, and accounts for 70% of weekend night admissions to hospital casualty departments. Whether these estimates are correct or not, they underline the direction that the public debate is taking and low/non-alcohol beer variants could potentially be the industry's sober reply to such claims.</p>
<p>While the low/non-alcohol beer segment accounted for only 35.6 million litres in 2008, a figure that is by no means indicative of a fundamental change in British drinking culture, buoyant growth rates have provided enough momentum for the industry to embrace such products and promote them accordingly. Bavaria has an extensive and innovative marketing strategy planned for 2009 based around the two main drivers for alcohol-free consumers - drink driving and sport. </p>
<p>The campaign, entitled 'Keep a clear head', consists of a new television commercial which will air over the summer, and major sports sponsorship initiatives with the likes of British Superbikes, Twenty20 cricket, one day cricket tests between England and Australia and Super League rugby. Furthermore, pregnant women are increasingly becoming part of the successful equation, with Bavaria's 2008 campaign, focused on the 'mums to be' and diet/fitness arenas, proving to be popular and relevant. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the two biggest alcohol-free drinking occasions are the early summer time (ideal for BBQ's, picnics and impulse purchases after work) and Christmas/New Year (ideal for designated drivers and those working Christmas overtime). In March 2009 Diageo also reformulated Kaliber and its packaging in a bid to reinvigorate the brand, which has been generically associated with the non-alcoholic beer segment in the UK.</p>
<p>Within this context, Euromonitor International believes that the low/non-alcohol beer segment will register a 5% volume CAGR over 2008-2013, a figure that could be significantly higher if manufacturers continue investing in the segment, both by improving flavour and educating consumers.  </p>

Nigeria spearheads optimistic outlook for beer sales in sub-Saharan Africa,"As volume growth of beer in developed markets is grinding to a halt, manufacturers are accelerating their efforts to tap into emerging economies that have been less impacted by the ongoing global financial crisis. Nigeria, with its high number of legal drinking age consumers, rising middle-class and geographically strategic positioning within the African continent, is hence emerging as one of the testing grounds for manufacturers' push into the sub-Saharan region. ","<p>As volume growth of beer in developed markets is grinding to a halt, manufacturers are accelerating their efforts to tap into emerging economies that have been less impacted by the ongoing global financial crisis.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div><img unselectable=""on"" src=""http://www.portal.euromonitor.com/reportgraphics\Articles\2a89e276-034d-4109-9793-e2796774bb10.jpg""><h3>Tapping into the lower end of the market</h3>
<p>According to Euromonitor International's preliminary findings, beer sales in the country will amount to 1.6 billion litres in 2009, registering 9% volume growth, marginally down from 10% in 2008. While Nigeria is set to retain the leading position in stout in the global volume rankings, with 315 million litres in 2009, equating to 10% volume growth on the previous year, high single digit growth rates will also be witnessed in all other beer segments, underlining the remarkable resilience of the sector in the country. </p>
<p>Small bars or 'beer parlours' are extremely popular in Nigeria and lead on-trade beer sales. According to industry sources, there are an estimated 500,000 such outlets throughout the country as beer consumption is very much a social activity, and, as a result, on-trade outlets dominate beer with around an 80% share of sales. The pronounced social element of Nigeria's drinking culture has thus also boosted the importance of aspirational credentials.</p>
<p>Although aspirational consumption and westernisation trends have been the primary drivers of the overall beer sector, which posted a 9% volume CAGR over 2004-2009, lower-income consumers are rapidly taking centre stage as manufacturers increase their efforts to provide affordable alternatives to popular home- brewed alcoholic variants. Premium and standard lager have hence traditionally capitalised on aspirational imagery, posting a buoyant 9% volume CAGR over 2004-2009, while the economy segment has been largely ignored until recently. </p>
<p>SABMiller's announcement in July 2009 that it plans an eight-fold increase in output at its Pabod Breweries unit in Nigeria by 2010, while seeking other potential acquisitions in the West African country, underlines the strategic importance that the country as well as the region holds in terms of boosting global beer volumes and counterbalancing the sobering performance of mature, developed markets. Nevertheless, SABMiller is going further than that, shifting its focus towards economy, domestically produced beer based on local sourcing. The company plans to produce more affordable brews using locally sourced ingredients such as cassava, a root vegetable that yields a rich starch, in place of more expensive imported ingredients.</p>
<h3>Africa emerges as one of the global beer drivers </h3>
<p>SABMiller is consciously targeting the - until recently - overlooked economy segment of a market that had been traditionally dominated by standard and premium offerings from leading rivals Diageo and Heineken, which are predicted to account for respective shares of 20% and 61% in 2009. </p>
<p>SABMiller is also looking at growing barley in a number of other African countries such as Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Zambia. It is already working with local farmers in Tanzania using a “hub and spoke” model, where one larger commercial farm supplies around 40% of the barley and trains smaller growers in the surrounding area to supply the rest. Minimising packaging costs by using alternatives such as cardboard or collapsible plastic containers would also assist in significantly raising penetration levels among lower- income consumers in a country where the World Bank estimates that up to 40 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 25 are unemployed.</p>
<p>While Nigeria's comparatively upbeat economic prospects and projected 8% beer volume CAGR over 2009-2014, according to Euromonitor International's provisional findings, underline the country's strategic importance for the beer industry, investments in a number of other previously overlooked African markets reaffirm the continent's potential over the short and medium term. </p>
<p>SABMiller announced in July 2009 that it will open a new US$125 million brewery and sparkling soft drinks plant in Angola within the year to support the country's growing demand for beverages. On the other hand, Diageo plans to expand the premium Windhoek beer brand across Africa during 2009 after acquiring the global rights to produce and distribute the brand outside its key South African and Namibian markets. Whether targeting the upwardly mobile middle-classes or the mass lower end of the market, beer is rediscovering its lost fizz on the African continent.</p>

The battle for America’s beer belly,"Facing flat to declining demand and volatile production costs, the US beer industry experienced a round of consolidation in the summer of 2008.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>AB InBev vs MillerCoors: Round 1</h3>
<p>In the first half of 2009 Anheuser-Busch, the US arm of AB InBev, can claim a slight advantage over MillerCoors, yet both companies can point to a string of small victories in certain areas while skipping over some less favourable results. Anheuser-Busch has been particularly successful in domestic premium lager, with the company's Bud Light Lime trouncing Miller Chill as America's preferred lime- flavoured light beer. Lime-flavoured beer remains a seasonal category, yet Anheuser-Busch's heavy advertising during the autumn and spring months kept the brand in the minds of US consumers when the weather turned warmer. The company's imported premium lager portfolio also performed extremely well, with Stella Artois experiencing strong double-digit growth.</p>
<p>AB InBev's performance in standard lager, the most critical US beer segment, was less successful as the company's share remained flat against a slight gain for MillerCoors. For AB InBev, share gains for its flagship Bud Light brand were balanced out by the continued long-term decline of Budweiser, the number two US beer brand. If the growth trends of the past four years hold true, Budweiser will lose its number two position to the rapidly surging Coors Light in 2011. For MillerCoors, the success of Coors Light, and the rise of MGD 64's within the ultra-light beer segment, and the continued growth of the company's lucrative dark beer portfolio, is tempered by the continued decline of Miller Lite. In the last three to four years Coors Light was aggressively promoted as the 'cold refreshment' beer, which proved to be very successful for the brand, while Miller Lite's brand position remained muddled.  Without a strong point of differentiation Miller Lite lost share to Bud Light and Coors Light. </p>
<h3>Imports and craft beer slowing down</h3>
<p>MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which together account for an 80% share of the US market, failed to make a dent in each other's sales in the first full year of competition. However, the rest of the market felt the companies' heft. Former superstar import brands like Heineken and Corona continued to see their shares decline, while The Boston Beer Company, the flagship US craft brewer, lost volume sales for the first time since 2001. The deteriorating US economy deserves some of the blame, yet the latest efforts from the major domestic brewers to add more premium offerings to their portfolios are proving to be the key factor behind the weakness in the import and craft segments.</p>
<h3>The battle continues</h3>
<p>MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch will be major US rivals for years to come, yet as the first full year of competition proved, taking share away from one another will be difficult. To be successful, Anheuser-Busch must successfully manage its booming premium beer portfolio against the long-term decline of Budweiser, the company's and America's number two beer brand, while MillerCoors must return Miller Lite to growth without cannibalising Coors Light or MGD 64. Meanwhile, the booming times of the early 2000s are likely to be over for leading importers and craft brewers such as Corona, Heineken and Samuel Adams, the number one craft brand, having reached high household penetration and no longer having that 'cool, unique' positioning that made Americans pick them over Anheuser-Busch or MillerCoors' products. Today it is Anheuser-Busch with Bud Light Lime and Stella Artois, and MillerCoors with Blue Moon, the rising Leinenkugel brand family, and Miller High Life that are making consumers excited about the beer category. </p>

<h3>Brazil leads in volume terms with a dominant player, but also has key local players </h3>
<p>The Brazilian market dwarfs all other Latin American markets with 40% of the region's beer volumes in 2008, nearly double the size of the second-placed Mexican market. The leading Brazilian brewer is A-B InBev, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of Brazilian market volumes in 2007, followed by Primo Schincariol (16% market share), FEMSA (9% market share) and Cervejaria Petrópolis (7%). </p>
<p>Both Primo Schincariol and Cervejaria Petrópolis are privately owned companies, which makes a hostile acquisition highly unlikely. Schincariol has in the past been linked to SABMiller and has recently undergone a substantial management change, with members of the Schincariol family taking up several key positions. Schincariol has had issues with rising costs recently and being part of a larger organisation could help turn things around - economies of scale and operational management from being part of a larger entity could help to lower costs.</p>
<h3>Mexico dominated by two brewers</h3>
<p>The Mexican beer market is dominated by two regional brewers, Modelo and FEMSA, which together held a 99% share in 2007. A-B InBev holds a 50.1% equity stake in Modelo, gained from the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch. This means that the acquisition opportunities in Mexico are limited due to the duopolistic structure of the market. However, as a result of A-B InBev's acquisition of Anheuser-Busch and its holding in Modelo, this could change.</p>
<h3>Modelo arbitration as a result of acquisition</h3>
<p>An opportunity for acquisition or investment may present itself due to InBev's acquisition of Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch has long held a 50.1% non-controlling equity stake in Modelo, held in accordance with an investment agreement drawn up at the time of Anheuser-Busch's initial investment in Modelo. Modelo is seeking arbitration in the US under Mexican law regarding the transfer of the equity stake to A-B InBev. Modelo believes that the investment agreement should have prevented the transfer of its shares without giving Modelo the opportunity to buy them first. A-B InBev believes that this claim is without merit.</p>
<p>A successful outcome for Modelo could provide opportunities for other brewers or investors, as they look for investment to help cover the purchase price. An investment in Modelo would give another brewer access to a beer market that has previously restricted acquisition opportunities as only Modelo and FEMSA have any sizeable share in the market and access to the successful Corona brand in the US. Modelo has one of the lowest debt ratios of any brewer and so could feasibly raise money to buy a substantial proportion if not all of the shares, but would accrue a large amount of debt in the process. The current economic climate has made credit expensive and access limited, so finding an investment partner would be a way to manage risk and lower costs.</p>
<p>If A-B InBev wins there is a chance that it could purchase more stock in Modelo, with the possibility of a controlling stake. This would further extend A-B InBev's dominance as the leading global brewer. There are issues surrounding this, the first being A-B InBev's large debt from the Anheuser-Busch acquisition, which may restrict whether or by how much it can increase its stake; the other is regulatory issues in the US, with Modelo owning several of the top imported beer brands and A-B InBev's 50% beer market share.</p>
<p>A solution could be to maintain the status quo or A-B InBev selling a portion of its stake to Modelo. The latter would free up cash for A-B InBev to enable it to pay down debt and give the principal shareholders of Modelo a larger stake in the company and still provide a limited income stream from Modelo. In either of these options the relationship between the brewers could also then be extended and formalised, with Modelo using A-B InBev's extensive global distribution to further its growth through joint venture agreements, increasing income for both companies.</p>
<h3>FEMSA an attractive target</h3>
<p>Of course one solution to an acquisition in both of the largest markets in Latin America would be the acquisition of FEMSA's beer assets. This is not without its issues, the first being that FEMSA's beer operations accounted for less than 24% of FEMSA's overall income in 2008; 60% of the company's income derives from its soft drinks business and the remainder from its retail operations (which in Mexico account for over 12% of FEMSA's beer sales). The soft drinks operation covers several Latin American markets that do not sell FEMSA beer, and is partially owned by The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC). TCCC could be a major obstacle to any company looking to acquire FEMSA, particularly if SABMiller, which is also a large Coca-Cola bottler, decides to get involved. TCCC may feel uncomfortable about a single company having such dominance of its southern hemisphere bottling operations. Heineken also has a stake in FEMSA's Brazilian operations and would be unhappy about having to work with SABMiller as it competes with the company in several markets in Africa, North America and Eastern Europe, which could potentially provide opposition to a deal. The splitting of the soft drinks and beer operations is an option, with FEMSA retaining the soft drinks operation and another brewer gaining control of its beer operations. This situation may involve the splitting of distribution and back office functions, which could prove difficult. </p>
<h3>Opportunities in other Latin American countries are limited</h3>
<p>Much of the rest of the region has limited opportunities for entry by acquisition due to dominant positions held by international brewers in several markets, most notably SABMiller and A-B InBev in the Colombian, Argentinian and Peruvian markets. Potentially adverse operating conditions due to nationalisation issues in countries like Venezuela would also provide market entry barriers.</p>
<h3>SABMiller the forerunner in any acquisition activity</h3>
<p>With large debts due to recent acquisition activity, opportunities in Latin America would probably be too expensive for Heineken, Carlsberg and A-B InBev. SABMiller would be the favourite for any move in the region due to a lower debt profile. Any acquisition that it makes would strengthen its current assets in the region but it faces hurdles with regard to several of the larger acquisitions. SABMiller acquired most of its Latin American operations through the acquisition of the family-controlled Bavaria brewery back in 2005 in a cash and equity swap deal, and so the possibility that SABMiller may acquire or invest in an equity stake in some of the larger privately owned brewers should not be dismissed.</p>
<p>Other brewers in time may look at the Latin American markets and try to strengthen their positions through acquisitions or equity stakes, but their major concern currently is paying down debt.</p>

Could women save the day for beer consumption in the UK?,"Through the introduction of much-hyped pink-hued variants and the indirect winking to women drinkers through the launch of  low/non-alcoholic products, tapping into female audiences has been the Holy Grail of the UK beer industry for years. The importance of the segment is becoming even more pronounced as recessionary pressures are forcing scores of pubs to close down at an unprecedented rate and beer sales appear to be crashing.  ","<p>Through the introduction of much-hyped pink-hued variants and the indirect winking to women drinkers through the launch of  low/non-alcoholic products, tapping into female audiences has been the Holy Grail of the UK beer industry for years. The importance of the segment is becoming even more pronounced as recessionary pressures are forcing scores of pubs to close down at an unprecedented rate and beer sales appear to be crashing.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>What women want</h3>
<p>According to Euromonitor International's provisional findings, beer posted a volume decline of more than 5% in 2008, continuing the negative growth trajectory that has haunted the category over the past five years. With industry sources suggesting that women account for less than a fifth of total beer sales in the UK, it is not surprising that manufacturers are pulling out all the stops to lure female drinkers into the category. </p>
<p>Eve is perhaps the most emblematic new product development, encompassing a multitude of key characteristics that illustrate manufacturers' renewed efforts. The product is both low in calories (123 calories per 250ml bottle) and in alcohol (3.1%  ABV), while it is brewed with added fruit flavourings such as lychee and passion fruit. Feldschlösschen, part of the Carlsberg Switzerland Group, produced Eve back in 2006 and global success led to it being trialled in 50 bars in Manchester in July 2009.</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Trials are also being used in the case of beer-based cocktails. The Dial, in Burton-upon-Trent, was chosen by Molson Coors in July 2009 to trial its beers mixed with other drinks. A range including such drinks as Kru Woo – peach schnapps and cranberry juice topped up with Kasteel Cru – is one of the ideas hit upon by the BitterSweet Partnership, the business launched by Molson Coors to make beer a more appealing choice for women. Initial response has proven to be more than positive, with the pub selling the range of 'beer cocktails' and experiencing an average 26% jump in beer sales on the nights they have been on offer.</p>
<p>BitterSweet Partnership has been set up to rectify the gender imbalance in beer consumption in the UK. Operating under the motto 'Run by women for women', the company's aim is to gain an insight into female consumers throughout the country. It is planning to run educational programmes covering the benefits of beer, develop products designed specifically for female taste buds, as well as implement initiatives to improve the serving and drinking experience. </p>
<p>Last but not least, it appears that female drinkers may also be receptive to variants previously associated with a healthy dose of machismo. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has said that in 2009 twice as many women have tried real ale compared to last year, a sign that the previously considered groundbreaking launch of the 'Girls' Guide to the Great British Beer Festival' has actually paid off. At the festival this year beer writer and tutor Melissa Cole has taken female drinkers round the festival in Girls' Guide themed tours.</p>
<p>Euromonitor International expects such efforts to increase in number and intensity as the beer category's increasingly sobering performance makes the expansion of its audience a necessity. The adoption of trials to identify trends, the launch of products that follow market demands rather than dictate them and structured and organised promotional and educational campaigns could all provide a significant boost to the ailing UK beer industry. On the other hand, with a volume CAGR decline of 1.6% forecast over 2009-2014, much more will need to be done to turn the tide. </p>

In an effort to address the issue of sales being notoriously skewed towards male consumption, low-carb/low- calorie new product variants are hence shifting the focus towards the emerging, and previously largely overlooked, segment of female drinkers, as well as health-conscious young urbanites.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Dynamic global entrance of low-carb/low-calorie beer offerings</h3>
<p>A series of new product launches spanning all regions is indicative of the significance of healthier alternatives in retaining and expanding beer audiences both in mature as well as emerging markets. In North America, both the US and Canada are embracing such developments. Cracked Canoe from Moosehead was launched in Canada in April 2009 and is a light, low-calorie beer containing only 3.5% ABV and less than 100 calories per bottle. Meanwhile, Select 55 from Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc, which was launched in September 2009 in the US, contains only 55 calories and, with an ABV as low as 2.4%, claims to be America's lightest beer, and is focused on replicating the success of MGD 64, which was launched in 2007 by Miller Brewing Co.</p>
<p>Australasia's fascination with low-calorie/low- carb beer was further illustrated by the success of Haägen Blonde from Independent Liquor (NZ) Ltd in New Zealand, launched in June 2008. Peroni Leggera from Pacific Beverages Pty Ltd, launched in Australia in February 2009, and Export 33 from DB Breweries Ltd and launched in New Zealand in November 2008, both took advantage of this momentum, with the former positioned as the 'first true premium beer offering lower carbohydrates and calories' and the latter underlining its standard pricing at a time when trading down remained a dominant trend. </p>
<p>Consumers in Scandinavian countries are also receptive to health and wellness-themed launches. Koff Lite from Sinebrychoff Oy Ab, a low-calorie extension of the established Koff brand, has managed to secure almost a 1% share in the domestic standard lager segment only a year after its launch. Additionally, Spendrups Bright from Spendrups Bryggeri AB, launched in Sweden in 2008, has also proved a success, primarily through tapping into female audiences. Within this context, Arctic Light from Macks Ølbryggeri AS, which was launched in Norway in February 2009, is also responding to the growing demand for low-carb variants.</p>
<p>The very broad geographical reach of new low- carb/low- calorie product launches within beer also includes countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. 2009 saw the launch of Efes Light %40 Daha Az Kalori from Anadolu Efes AS in Turkey, containing 40% fewer calories than standard beer (only 81 calories per pack) while at the same time pushing the lower alcoholic content agenda with an ABV of only 3%. Furthermore, Carlsberg Lite from Carlsberg AS was launched in the United Arab Emirates in 2009, using the 30% lower calories offering in conjunction with the strong Carlsberg brand name to tap into the emerging health and wellness trend in the country. </p>
<p>Asia-Pacific has traditionally been one of the major strongholds and pioneers of health and wellness trends and product developments. The successful launch of Sapporo Beer Fine from Makoto-Ya (S) Pte Ltd in May 2008 in Singapore, offering a reduced-sugar and low-carb content for a highly competitive price, led to the subsequent launch of Pure Blonde from 6 Drunk Men Pte Ltd in October 2008. Pure Blonde has 70% fewer carbohydrates compared to standard lager variants, while retaining a standard ABV level and 'making no concessions' in terms of flavour. </p>
<p>Acknowledging maturity limitations, the issue of overrepresentation of male audiences and opportunities arising beyond the machismo positioning that has traditionally driven beer sales, the low-calorie/low-carb trend appears to be healthier than ever. </p>

<p>In Eastern Europe, beer packaged in PET bottles is commonplace. In Ukraine, for instance, over 20% of beer packaging was made from PET plastic in 2008. Thanks to improvements in barrier technology, and an increased focus on light-weighting packaging as a means of cost savings, manufacturers are increasingly moving to this format over more expensive - if traditional - glass bottles or metal beverage cans.</p>
<h4>Economy beer leads this segment</h4>
<p>The success of PET bottles in Eastern Europe is driven by their use for economy lagers in a market where cost is one of the biggest considerations among consumers The flexibility of PET and the low price of packaging makes it particularly attractive for the 1 to 2 litre sizes bottled used in this segment.  However, even with such high penetration, consumer perception is still a barrier preventing it from making inroads into higher end branded beers. </p>
<p>Such success may not be achievable in other locations. While PET bottles have gained popularity in Eastern European beer markets and continue to do so, they remain stagnant in the US. This is largely due to image—PET bottles do not carry the premium perception that glass bottles do in the US, as they are used with economy products in all alcoholic drinks categories. Glass, in contrast, is both familiar and offers greater weight and clarity than PET bottles. Because of this, beer is only found in PET bottles in a few niche on-trade channels, such as sports arenas, where the un-breakability of PET offers safety advantages. </p>
<h4>PET lacks the premium perception associated with glass</h4>
<p>PET bottles, for all their advantages, simply lack the premium appeal of glass when it comes to beer. As the middle class populations of Eastern European countries grow over the long-term future, making premium products become more affordable and popular, it is likely that the growth of PET used to bottle beer will slow. Until then, the less expensive and more flexible PET bottles will continue to be popular among manufacturers and consumers alike.</p>

New Transit Law puts temporary brakes on Costa Rican beer category,"The introduction of a new Transit Law is prompting a sharp decline in consumption as consumers take time to adjust, while market leader Florida Bebidas SA quickly reacts to the new stricter legislation. ","<p>The introduction of a new Transit Law is prompting a sharp decline in consumption as consumers take time to adjust, while market leader Florida Bebidas SA quickly reacts to the new stricter legislation. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Large yellow hearts with halos above can be found painted on the winding roads throughout Costa Rica. These denote the site of a fatal crash and serve as constant reminders of the damage caused by drink driving. The impact of Costa Rica's mountainous terrain and tropical weather cannot compare to the reckless driving habits of its citizens. Frustration over continued tragedies on the roads led to a new Transit Law being passed in December 2008 to try and deal with the problem. Stiffer penalties for anyone found guilty of drink driving, speeding excessively or driving recklessly include an immediate jail sentence. </p>
<h3>Consumption detour</h3>
<p>The new Transit Law has come at a terrible time for alcoholic drinks companies. In conjunction with the local effects of the global credit crunch, Costa Ricans are not only less prone to going out to restaurants and bars, but are also now scared of the new possibility of winding up in jail on their drive home. This has resulted in a steep decline in the on-trade channel as consumers look to cheaper off-trade options, such as entertaining at home, to avoid having to drive. </p>
<p>With a near monopoly of the Costa Rican beer sector (99% total volume share), local manufacturer Florida Bebidas SA has much at stake. Through aggressive licensing agreements of brands such as Corona and Heineken, as well as constant innovation in terms of new product developments, such as the creative 2009 limited edition beer Rock Ice Ginseng, the company is aggressively trying to maintain its position, and thus has been quick to react to the new legislation.</p>
<p>Initially, Florida Bebidas responded by re-launching its non-alcoholic beer brand Kaiser while celebrating its commendable 10-year designated driver campaign. Kaiser offers brief relief for some consumers, but it is unlikely that the current boost to the tiny non-alcoholic beer segment will last for long as consumer preference for popular brands is strong and ingrained in tradition. </p>
<p>More promising is the recent introduction of the brand Bremen, which is actually a re-launch of the now defunct Cervecería Americana from the 1990s. Bremen offers the lowest ABV of any beer in Florida Bebidas' portfolio at 2.8%, well below the nearest brand Bavaria Light at 3.4%. Not only does it offer a more sensible option for happy hour or an accompaniment to dinner, but its light taste with fewer than 100 calories also serves as a focal point to segue the brand into the company's strategy to pursue more female consumers in the future. </p>
<h3>Imports seem immune </h3>
<p>Over the past five years, imports, notably Mexican brands Carta Blanca, Corona and Tecate, have seen a strong surge, with a robust 22% total volume CAGR compared to 2% for domestic brands. Albeit growing from a small base, this trend is still noteworthy in the largely domestic beer dominated market. </p>
<p>Interestingly, amidst the dismal environment of the beer sector in 2009, imports have been the exception, posting total volume growth of 5% compared to a 7% decline for domestic beer sales. The discrepancy can be attributed to the beer sector in Costa Rica being divided into two main segments. </p>
<p>The first and largest group consists of locals and tourists who almost exclusively consume domestic brands. Locals drink off- and on-trade whereas tourists mainly visit bars or restaurants. On top of the new Transit Law, the downturn in tourism and local consumer spending has added insult to injury when it comes to pricier on-trade beer consumption in 2009, mainly affecting this segment and hurting domestic beer with a 16% on-trade volume slide. </p>
<p>The second consumer group is made up of expats who enjoy imports and some adventurous Costa Ricans who give them a try. This group tends to be more affluent and less affected by the economic downturn of 2009, so is more able to continue spending on premium imports. These consumers prefer to do their shopping off-trade out of habit as well as due to the fact that Florida Bebidas has a near stranglehold on national on-trade beer distribution with its domestic brands. Whereas 51% of domestic lager is consumed off-trade, the comparable figure for imports is an overwhelming 82%, with increasing penetration through supermarkets. </p>
<h3>Speed bump or new route?</h3>
<p>The nosedive of the Costa Rican beer category sector in 2009 will likely be more of a temporary shock than a sustained long-term trend. As consumers adopt new social habits in response to the Transit Law,  there is also hope that there will be a shift towards more responsible driving. Likewise, there is also an opportunity for Florida Bebidas to promote lighter beers for more sensible consumption. Although beer sales are declining in 2009, stronger products like RTDs and spirits are being even harder hit. This could translate into a reallocation of more consumers to beer over the forecast period, making up for the losses of 2009 with a potentially larger future consumer base. </p>

Offloading beer at FEMSA could force Coke’s arm with KOF,The decision by Mexican beverage giant FEMSA to entertain suitors for its beer business could signal the first stage of a company-wide sell -off and twist Coca-Cola's arm into buying a controlling stake in its biggest Latin American bottler.

<h2>Revising the bottler model</h2>
<p>Since August, when PepsiCo raised its bid to buy back Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) and PepsiAmericas (PAS) for US$7.8 billion, there has been speculation as to whether archrival Coca-Cola will look to revise its own model and bring its biggest bottlers under one corporate roof. Although CEO Muhtar Kent reiterated his commitment to the current bottler model as recently as July, the For Sale sign newly hung over FEMSA Cerveza might have knock-on implications for the future direction of Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF), the soft drinks division in which Coke already holds a 32% stake. </p>
<p>FEMSA's possible offload of beer is in itself no surprise. FEMSA Cerveza, which is 100% company-owned, has been finding life tough in its head to head with Grupo Modelo, the bigger brother of Mexico's beer duopoly. In 2008, FEMSA held a 43% volume share of Mexico's beer market, against Modelo's 55%, according to Euromonitor International. And while FEMSA's beer division is global in profile, there has been downward pressure on margins in the US and Brazil, two key external markets. Critically, the contribution of beer to the company coffers has been in decline, fuelling 25% in 2008 compared to 28% in 2006.</p>

<p>What is surprising is the timing of the possible sale. Before the onset of the current global financial crisis there had been a fiesta of deals as the global beer sector consolidated, but FEMSA Cerveza had been a largely closed shop. Instead, the company has chosen to open dialogue with possible suitors at a time when Mexico and Latin America are experiencing the sharpest economic downturn in over a decade and when financing for deals has never been tougher. It begs the question as to whether FEMSA, which is effectively a family-run company, has a wider ulterior agenda.</p>
<h2>Cut and run</h2>
<p>One possible explanation, and the key to the possible implications for the soft drinks division, is that the latest generation of Mexican families controlling FEMSA are ready to cash in their chips, with the current period of recession forcing their hand. It is, perhaps, also significant that Eugenio Garza, the company's oldest surviving descendant of Isaac Garza, one of the four Monterrey businessmen that founded FEMSA in 1890, died in May last year, aged 84. He was FEMSA's Honorary Life Chairman and, although not active in the day-to-day running of the business, was symbolic of a bygone corporate era in Mexico.</p>
<p>The important point is that Mexico has been experiencing a shift in its business culture over the past decade, with the latest generation of corporate leaders less reluctant than their parents and grandparents to give up control of the companies they own. Having been educated in a post-NAFTA world, many of these new executives believe that family-run businesses fit uncomfortably into what is an increasingly competitive global operating environment. </p>
<p>If this way of thinking is reflected at FEMSA, and if the new generation of Mexican owners are looking to sell up, there is a strategic logic to the timing of the possible beer sale. Specifically, selling beer now has potential to net a tidy US$9 billion, which could then be reinvested to build stronger growth in the soft drinks division, which last year fuelled over 49% of company revenue, up from 47% in 2006.</p>
<p>In 2010, as hinted by the CEO of PepsiCo last week in an earnings call, the soft drinks industry is likely to experience a unique period of expansion opportunities, with the global economic downturn creating a climate of more cost-effective investment. In a buyer's market, what better time, therefore, to free up a big wad of cash?</p>
<h2>The bigger picture</h2>
<p>Over the medium term, a stronger soft drinks division at FEMSA is likely to command a higher sale price, should the families that hold 54% of KOF's capital stock look to sell up (Coke holds 32% and the remainder is traded on the Mexican and New York Stock Exchanges). The beer sale could, therefore, be the opening gambit of a wider plan to maximise return. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, as a major stakeholder in KOF, would benefit from any future upside. But, if the company is re-thinking its bottler model in the wake of PepsiCo's move, it might also decide that the bigger upside is to make its own move on FEMSA, its second biggest bottler in the world and its biggest in Latin America, sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>The relationship between KOF and Coca-Cola is much like that between PepsiCo and its bottlers PBG and PAS, in that KOF is firmly harnessed to the Coca-Cola machine. Hence, Mexican family shareholders would have restricted negotiation leverage should a takeover start to gain momentum. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola looks to have all the big cards to play and might prefer to wait things out. But, the combination of PepsiCo's strategic bottler buy-back and FEMSA's likely offload of beer might make the timing of any revision to Coke's existing bottler model more critical. Put simply, this latest move by FEMSA to sell off beer could push Coke into showing its hand, one way or the other.</p>

C&C increases its focus on cider and beer with the acquisition of Constellation Brands’ cider operations,"The deal, which will be completed by mid-2010, will benefit both parties.

For C&amp;C, the deal represents a continuation of the company's strategy to focus on cider and beer following the acquisition of Tennent's (and other beer assets) from A-B InBev and makes the divestment of its spirits division more likely.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>More resources for Constellation Brands to focus on wine </h3>
<p>Following the spin-off of its US beer import and UK distribution businesses into separate joint ventures, the company's cider portfolio seemed more and more out of place for an increasingly wine-focused company. This lack of focus has meant that the brands have not had the same levels of investment that the two other big cider players in the UK, C&C and Scottish & Newcastle/Heineken, have managed to put into brands such as Magners and Bulmers. This has contributed to the company seeing its share of the UK cider/perry market decline by six percentage points to 13% between 2005 and 2009.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that Constellation has sold. While the amount (£45 million) it receives will do little to pay down its high long-term debt (145% of equity), it will allow the company to focus more of its resources on its struggling wine business.</p>
<h3>C&amp;C spreads the risk</h3>
<p>For C&C the key benefit of the acquisition is that it will reduce the company's reliance on one brand. The company's fluctuating sales performance in the past few years has been based on the performance of its Bulmers/Magners brand. The additional brands, ranging from economy Diamond White to the more premium Gaymers, will enable it to compete with Heineken at all price points. Equally importantly, the acquisition will greatly enhance its presence in the off-trade, where the company has previously been weak. The off-trade accounted for 62% of the UK cider/perry market in 2009 and so greater strength there is vital. Finally, with the company's focus on cider/perry and beer, many of these brands should receive more attention and thus see an upturn in sales.</p>
<p>C&C's increased focus on cider/perry and beer means that its spirits and liqueurs division is looking increasingly out of place, as Constellation Brands found with its cider/perry portfolio. This makes it even more likely that C&C will be open to offers for its spirits division and its flagship brand Tullamore Dew, the world's second biggest Irish whiskey brand. The portfolio should be tempting to any company looking to strengthen its position in the US as well as in Eastern Europe, such as Fortune Brands and Brown-Forman as well as more outside bets like Campari and William Grant.</p>

The spectre of taxation haunts beer sales in Russia,"It was not so long ago that the Russian paradigm seemed to embody ideal market dynamics - steadily rising disposable incomes and an adult playground for alcoholic drinks manufacturers that utilised the country's infamous drinking culture as a stepping stone for witnessing massive gains in both volume and value terms.

The transition from consumption of the national tipple to lower ABV variants in the context of the rapidly advancing westernisation trend found its champion in beer, which was tipped to be in an indisputably bullish mode for years to come. The landing of the recession turned established notions on their head around the globe, and Russia was not spared. Beer sales were to soon follow down the path drawn by an economy in shambles. Nevertheless, and while wild cards can rarely be coherently included in projections, the recent tripling of the duty tax on beer and suggestions for more stringent control of the overall Russian alcoholic drinks market can surely be nothing but catastrophic. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Kicking a market when it's down</h3>
<p>The warning signs have, of course, been there for a while. Reminiscent of similar media-backed campaigns that are nowadays becoming commonplace in mature Western markets - the US and the UK readily come to mind - a series of reports and polls claiming the Russian public's support for the measures started surfacing as far back as early September. President Medvedev himself went as far as declaring alcoholism to be the country's 'national tragedy'. Funnily enough, the collapsing economy had already guaranteed the drop in sales that his government appears to be so eagerly pursuing. Overall alcoholic drinks sales in the country declined by 4% in 2009, with all major categories literally dropping off a cliff. Beer declined by 4%, wine plummeted by 6%, spirits – and vodka - stared at the recessionary abyss with a drop of almost 8%, further solidifying the downward trend that consistently gripped the segment over 2004-2009. </p>
<p>The recently approved bill disproportionately penalising beer by raising tax by 200% becomes even more illogical taking into consideration the category's instrumental role in assisting the shift away from spirits, with vodka being undoubtedly the primary root of the country's centuries-old bingeing problem. The bill also includes proposals for an increase in 2011 and 2012 of 11% and 20%, respectively. Conversely, a floor price of RUB89 (US$3) per 0.5 litres of vodka was also introduced on 1 January, effectively forcing struggling lower middle-class consumers out of the market altogether and into the hands of an already thriving black market. According to the chief of the ministry's economic department, illegal alcohol production in the Russian market already exceeded 30% of the total in 2009. </p>
<p>The tax rise is flat and across all products and so will hit the economy segment the most as there is less room to mitigate the cost of the increase to the consumer due to being a lower-margin product and economy consumers being more price-sensitive. Within this context, of the other multinational brewers active in Russia, a slant towards the premium end of the market may largely insulate Baltika and SABMiller, although the latter brewer warned late in 2009 that consumers were trading down from its brands. On the other hand, Carlsberg and Anadolu Group, the leading companies in the economy lager segment, might stand to gain from consumers trading down from standard lager, a shift that could assist in partly compensating for the economy segment's dire prospects. </p>
<h3>History repeating</h3>
<p>Russia has a rich history of top-down attempts to tackle alcohol abuse and vodka had always been at the epicentre of the debate. Alexander III called for the establishment of a state vodka monopoly (vinnaia monopoliia) in order to allegedly 'curb drunkenness' in 1893, insisting that the monopoly was an attempt to reform the drinking habits of the people and not to increase revenue. By 1914, vodka revenue comprised an eye-watering one-third of the state's income. As soon as Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985, he also began a major drive to eliminate alcoholism, primarily by limiting the hours and venues for the sale of vodka. People began to start their own distilleries instead, forming a flourishing black market in the production of samogon, or moonshine. Interestingly, many also began resorting to alcohol in perfumes and other products, leading to a sharp rise in cases of alcohol poisoning. </p>
<p>With Russia's GDP falling by a record 10.9% in the second quarter of 2009, filling up the empty state coffers might not be directly mentioned among the government's targets for introducing these most recent measures, although the historic parallels – and colossal failures of the past - are there for anyone to see.  </p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Perfectly positioned</h3>
<p>With Islamic law forbidding the consumption, manufacture and trade of alcohol in any form and anti-smuggling programmes run by the Iranian government further limiting parallel trade alternatives, non-alcoholic beer witnessed a monumental growth trajectory in Iran over 2004-2009, posting a volume CAGR of 26%. The recent state-backed initiative to shift consumption away from carbonates played an integral role in retaining this unprecedented momentum, with the burgeoning non-alcoholic beer segment registering 25% total volume growth in 2009, a feat not many markets around the world can boast in the midst of the Great Recession.  </p>
<p>Non-alcoholic beer is benefiting from the very active performance of the state-owned Behnoush Iran Co, which dominates sales, accounting for a 75% volume share in 2009. Although the company targets mainly young Iranians, it also tries to tap into other demographics by promoting non-alcoholic beer and malt drinks as good for pregnant women at the same time that government- sponsored campaigns are focusing on the harmful side effects of cola carbonates. </p>
<p>Within this context, and directly opposing trends witnessed throughout the Middle East and Africa region, westernisation seems to operate as an anti-trend, with domestically-produced non-alcoholic beer being promoted as a carbonate alternative fittingly replacing the vilified and iconic Western cola beverages. Maintaining a state-owned virtual monopoly through Behnoush Iran Co, international brewers thus appear to be being essentially forced out of the picture. </p>
<p>But they are not. The increasing number of supermarkets/hypermarkets in Iran, growing in parallel with the scores of young urbanites that are nowadays less suspicious towards the West than their parents' generation, is boosting volume sales of imported non-alcoholic beer. Although the volume shares of multinationals such as Carlsberg A/S, Bavaria NV and Heineken NV remained relatively low in 2009, the popularity of foreign brands is increasing in line with the shelf space accorded to them. Imported brands of non-alcoholic beer are also starting to be offered in high-end restaurants and hotels. Furthermore, according to official statistics, the number of illegal importers of alcoholic drinks is increasing year-on-year, with alcohol being commonly imported from neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Armenia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Kurdistan and Russia. </p>
<p>With a forecast mind-boggling 28% volume CAGR for non-alcoholic beer sales over 2009-2014 and a society that is slowly but steadily reaching out to the West regardless of the numerous barriers, Iran provides a unique case study of potential opportunities in the most adverse conditions - a small lesson for international players facing a rising wave of prohibitionist rhetoric around the globe. </p>

<p>Euromonitor International's new global briefing analyses the measures that companies have taken in light of this new operating environment and how they fit in with long term strategies.  </p>
<h3>Key findings include: </h3>
<p>Top 4 brewers account for over 40% of global beer volumes in 2009: A-B InBev, SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg have substantially increased volumes and global presence through acquisition activity in the last decade. </p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch InBev is established as the global leader: Posting a 19.5% market share, A-B InBev's volume sales are over double those of its nearest rival SABMiller.</p>
<p>Joint ventures and equity stakes improve volumes further: The top three brewers hold substantial stakes in several other leading brewers, in addition to operating joint ventures with other partners. This increases their global reach further and creates strategic blocks to competitor acquisitions.</p>
<p>Impact of economic crisis: The economic downturn has caused or accelerated a decline in volumes in several key markets particularly in Europe. The differing degrees to which countries were impacted illustrates the need for geographic diversity.  </p>
<p>Consolidation still continuing, but should slow: Acquisition activity is still continuing with the announcement that Heineken is to buy FEMSA. Consolidation should, however slow due to lack of viable targets and the high debts incurred during recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>Domestic organic growth drives Chinese brewers: Growth in beer consumption has catapulted Chinese players into the top 10 global brewers. With China's market growth set to continue their importance to the industry will further increase. </p>

Shift focus to sub- Saharan Africa, however, and beer is no longer part of the problem, far from it - it becomes part of the solution. Providing an alternative to the lethal moonshine flooding the region's markets, beer holds the key to minimising health risks, spurring local economies and skyrocketing manufacturer sales. Following up on the Kenyan president's recent appeal to distillers and brewers to develop products targeting low-income earners in the country, Euromonitor International takes a closer look at the extraordinary present and future prospects of the category in Kenya and the African continent.  </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Kenya: economy beer saves the day </h3>
<p>The state and unique characteristics of the Kenyan alcoholic drinks and beer markets can be used as a rather insightful case study for deciphering trends and opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa. More than half of the total volume of alcohol consumed in the country is illicitly produced, a fact that takes a heavy or sometimes even fatal toll on consumers' health, while at the same time negatively affecting the government's revenue collection efforts. More worrying is the scale of illegal sales of spirits, which continues unabated. While the Kenyan government largely relies on alcohol-related taxes to make up its annual budget, industry sources suggest that the country could be losing up to KES4 billion (US$54 million) in tax revenue annually. Illicit sales have indeed been a perennial problem in Kenya, but contraband products virtually flooded the market when the state introduced the KEBS mark of quality and excise duty on spirits and wine. This development forced sharp price increases, creating a void which was then filled by unscrupulous alcoholic drinks manufacturers. </p>
<p>Diageo Plc, owner of East African Breweries Ltd (EABL), persuaded the Kenyan government to collaborate on an initiative by reducing duty on a new economy beer brand, Senator Keg, back in 2005. Initially positive results from the project led to ministers waiving all duty on Senator Keg in 2007, which sells for around KES11.70 for a 330ml glass – only slightly more than the local moonshine. The beer has a 6% alcohol content, while that of illicit spirits is about 40-50%, but it has nevertheless proved extremely popular. The brand spearheaded growth for the burgeoning economy lager segment that became one of the primary drivers of the category over the review period. Currently controlling 30% of economy lager volumes in Kenya, Senator Keg witnessed monumental success while becoming one of the most iconic entry level variants for the legions of impoverished drinkers of moonshine. The benefits are hence threefold; consumers get a healthier product, the government gets more revenue and the industry is booming. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the situation is a little less rosy than it appears at first glance. Recent, severe droughts in Kenya caused cash-strapped consumers to trade back down to moonshine in the last six months of 2009, causing economy lager to post a sobering 11% total volume decline for the year. While this should be considered nothing more than a temporary blip in the steadily advancing penetration rates of economy beer variants in the country, it does serve as a reminder of the volatile conditions and potential pitfalls faced by manufacturers that are active in the continent. </p>
<h3>Sub-Saharan Africa: sowing the seeds of sorghum</h3>
<p>On the other hand, Diageo is not the only major manufacturer shifting focus to the African continent.  As far back as 2002, SABMiller's Ugandan subsidiary, Nile Breweries, obtained a government tax break for sorghum production. On a similar note to Diageo's Senator Keg success story, the company then began producing affordable, clear sorghum lager, named Eagle, and selling it more than 10% cheaper than standard products in the market. Most importantly, the company provided a vital boost to the local economy by promoting the cultivation of sorghum and hence essentially assisting in creating the consumer base for its products. Today, around 8,000 smallholder farms have direct contracts with Nile Breweries and Eagle. The brand is also sold in other African countries having reached volume sales of 605 million litres in 2009 in the Africa and Middle East region, and witnessing consistently stratospheric growth according to the company.</p>
<p>Going forward, SABMiller is investing US$370 million in capital projects in Africa in the financial year ending March 2010, although this is set to level off at around US$200 million per year in the following years. According to the company, Uganda and Zambia were SABMiller's best performing markets in terms of volume growth in the first half of 2009, with lager volumes up 18% and 23%, respectively. A key part of SABMiller's growth strategy on the continent is to further reduce its reliance on imported raw materials for brewing, thus cutting production costs while playing a pivotal role in transforming local producers into loyal consumers. The brewer currently imports 82% of raw materials required for its brewing operations across Africa, although it plans to directly employ 44,000 farmers across the continent by 2015. Tanzania is expected to be fully self-sufficient for the company's barley needs before this deadline. To the bewilderment of Western anti-alcohol lobbyists, beer has surfaced as the solution yet again. </p>
<h3>Unique opportunities</h3>
<p>As the sun sets on the mature beer markets of Western Europe and North America, key players' hesitant first steps in emerging markets appear to be bearing fruit. Among them, sub-Saharan countries provide some ideal fundamentals, namely minimal per capita consumption, massive numbers of consumers of legal drinking age and favourable demographics. The comparative lack of social mobility and the burden of contraband sales are the two major problems weighing heavily on the industry's short and medium-term prospects in the continent. Only, this time round, the industry is part of the solution. </p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>The price of maturity</h3>
<p>Whichever way one looks at the figures, the picture is not pretty. Overall beer sales in the US posted flat total volume growth in 2009 primarily on the back of relatively solid sales in the economy segment, while premium variants virtually mirrored the economy's collapse. Considering the uninspiring performance of the category throughout the review period, which achieved only a meagre 1% total volume CAGR, the drop should not be considered particularly sharp or surprising.</p>
<p>Shifting the spotlight onto the UK does not provide for much relief, far from it. Beer sales in the country appear to have witnessed a further acceleration in their consistently downward trajectory to account for more than a 5% total volume decline in 2009, down from an already disappointing 4% volume CAGR decline over 2004-2009. However, it is after focusing on the on-trade's performance that the real carnage begins to take shape. With a historically high average of 40 pubs closing their doors for good every week throughout the country and on-trade beer sales posting a 7% collapse, economy lager appears to be the only major segment providing some respite. Posting a healthy 2.3% total volume increase over 2009 and diametrically reversing its 5% CAGR decline of 2004-2009, economy lager is surfacing as the major benefactor of the inescapable trading down trend. </p>
<p>A battered on-trade, rampant trading down and stalling top-line growth figures hence pretty much summarise the state of both the ailing UK and US beer markets. Adding insult to injury, key industry players seem to be largely constrained by a certain inertia factor which is limiting their innovative efforts and restricting radical and adventurous experimentation. And it is exactly this gap in the market that the rising tide of microbrewers is successfully tapping into, seemingly overcoming operational barriers, shunning the much-vaunted economising and 'light' mega-trends and trampling on mass-produced offerings.</p>
<h3>Crafting something different</h3>
<p>While major manufacturers have been busy lowering the ABV and carbohydrate content of their new launches, an advancing wave of small brewers are instead focusing on flavour, texture and character. Focusing on product authenticity and uniqueness, utilising provocative marketing techniques and underlining the small scale of their production are all paying relatively far greater dividends than the respective marketing pushes that the beer behemoths can afford.</p>
<p>According to US trade body the Brewers Association, sales of craft beers in the US posted high single digit year-on-year volume growth in 2009, while the UK's Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) highlighted a similar, albeit marginally slower, mid-single digit rise for the segment in the UK. Although the first stages of stratospheric expansion enjoyed by craft and small batch variants were readily dismissed on the grounds of their comparatively minute share of the market, their momentum shows no sign of subsiding any time soon. </p>
<p>From the controversy sparked by Brewdog's ingeniously marketed launches to the traditional twist of Samuel Adams' offerings, craft beer variants have managed to capture the public imagination and appeal to young drinkers who are frequently on the lookout for new trends and brands that speak to their individual preferences. </p>
<p>Major brewers might be visibly focused on promoting their light products, but that does not mean that they have ignored the opportunities presented by the craft segment. Traditionally, when major brewers introduce craft-style products they go to great pains to avoid being affiliated with the brand and take a very deliberate approach to putting the product out to the market. When Coors Brewing launched Blue Moon in 1995 the company was very careful not to link itself to the brand while promoting it through word of mouth, rather than a full-on marketing blitz. Similar ventures should be expected to take place in the short and medium term, and the reasoning is simple. With anaemic total beer volume growth for the US and an outright decline of 1% for the UK expected over 2009-2014, premiumisation will continue to be the primary vehicle and driver for escaping the minefield of maturity. Craft has been established as synonymous with premium and – most importantly - has proved to be relatively impervious to recessionary pressures that are otherwise difficult to shake off. Now, there is something to think about. </p>

Foster’s to demerge beer and wine operations,"Foster's, the leading Australian brewer and wine company, has announced that it is looking to demerge its wine assets from its beer operations into two separately listed companies. The demerger has been prompted by the continuing poor performance of its wine division. The demerger is not expected until early 2011 and the company states that it has currently not received any offers for either its wine or beer business.","<p>Foster's, the leading Australian brewer and wine company, has announced that it is looking to demerge its wine assets from its beer operations into two separately listed companies. The demerger has been prompted by the continuing poor performance of its wine division. The demerger is not expected until early 2011 and the company states that it has currently not received any offers for either its wine or beer business.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Wine has been a drag on performance</h3>
<p>Foster's move into wine started after its growth in beer volumes in its core Australian market stalled in the mid 1990s. It has made several acquisitions in wine including Miranda Blass in 1996 for A$482 million, the A$2.6 billion of Beringer in California in 2001, and finally in 2005 it acquired Southcorp in a A$3.2 billion acquisition. It has had to write down the value of its wine assets twice, most recently announcing a A$1.3 billion write down before tax to take effect in the 2010 financial year. Foster's share of the global wine market has fallen slightly from its peak of 1.4% in 2006 to 1.3% in 2009.</p>
<p>Although it is perceived that Foster's overpaid for its wine assets, particularly Southcorp, there was market rationale behind it. Back in the mid-1990s and even in the mid part of the last decade, moving into wine seemed to make strategic sense, with wine growth rates in the UK, the US and Australia outstripping those of beer. </p>
<p>For these reasons, coupled with the glut of Australian wine assets currently available and the capital needed to produce wine, Foster's wine assets as a whole may not be particularly interesting to another alcohol drinks player or another type of buyer, and so it may struggle to find a purchaser. However, its individual brands, particularly its larger mass-market brands and a few of its premium brands, may prove interesting to other parties.</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2008, however, growth rates began to fall, and being reliant on the two export markets of the US and the UK has not helped the company. In the US and the UK, Foster's has faced the combined gains of the Australian dollar against both the US dollar and the pound. Moreover, the glut of Australian wine brands, innovative brand building strategies and the ease of entry if the right routes to market are secured have also put pressure on Foster's. In the US, for example, Yellow Tail, another Australian wine brand, has seen huge success, increasing its share of still light grape wine from 0.1% in 2001 to 3% in 2009, and was one of the major drivers behind Australian wine imports in the US market by making wine less complex to consumers and developing innovative branding strategies. In the UK, competition from other New World producers like Concha y Toro has put pressure on Foster's wine brands. Concha y Toro increased its market share in still light grape wine from 0.2% in 2002 to 2.8% in 2009. This was achieved without any major acquisitions. Wine remains a substitutional product and it has proven difficult to fend off new entrants. This has allowed major retailers to pursue low level pricing, further reducing profitability, which favours lower-cost New World producers based in Chile, Argentina and South Africa.</p>

<h3>Demerger could open up opportunities for brewers </h3>
<p>The demerger will also remove Foster's main defence against corporate predators for its beer business. For several years the wine business and its poor performance has acted as a deterrent to the leading four brewers, which have been on a near-decade-long acquisition spree. Foster's market share of global beer volumes in 2009 was 0.6%, so it is not the largest possible acquisition target available, but the Australian market is attractive in terms of the margins it offers and Foster's does command the highest share in the country.</p>
<p>Three of the large brewers (A-B InBev, Carlsberg and Heineken) have limited operations (mostly licensing deals with either Lion Nathan or Foster's) in the Australian market and Foster's may appeal to them. Recent acquisitions, high debts, shareholding structures and access to and cost of finance could limit their ability to take part in any acquisition activity. However, as the demerger is not expected to take place until early 2011, this could give them some breathing space. Carlsberg in particular faces uncertain times in its core European markets and so acquiring Foster's could be a way of gaining a wider geographic spread to mitigate further falls in volumes in its key markets.</p>
<p>Pacific Beverages, SABMiller's joint venture, has carved out a successful niche in the Australian market, pushing a premium focused strategy. Pacific Beverages has managed to achieve a 2% market share in less than four years, mostly at the expense of Foster's, and has recently significantly expanded production capacity. SABMiller may need support from its joint venture partner Coca-Cola Amatil, which may be reluctant to invest in such a large purchase that could significantly reduce its ability to expand its own operations for several years. Competition could be intense for such a business and SABMiller is known for not being prepared to overpay for any acquisition. However, if the price is right, it would be remiss of SABMiller not to test the waters, even if just to push up the price for future competitors.</p>
<p>Other brewers may also be interested. Asahi has stated its intention of growing its business outside Japan to offset declines in its domestic market. The acquisition of Foster's could help it achieve this. Suntory could also be interested for the same reasons. Molson Coors acquired a 5% stake in Foster's in late 2008 through a third party, and could be looking to capitalise on a  company whose shares were trading below the average for the industry but had a sound beer business. Foster's may suit Molson Coors' conservative acquisition strategy after it got its fingers burnt in a previous acquisition. Foster's would also be a good fit in that it operates in an English speaking market and has established routes to market (part of the reason a previous acquisition failed). This may be a good way for Molson Coors to make a relatively safe acquisition, but it would not solve its major issue of a lack of potential future volume growth. </p>
<p>Modelo could also be a contender. Australia is the fourth largest export market for its Corona Extra brand, and its relatively low-debt profile means that it could have the means for the acquisition. However, this would be the first major acquisition it has made outside its domestic market. Instead, it could prefer to attempt to buy back its own shares from A-B InBev and may be saving for this possibility. A-B InBev could look to partner Modelo, using its low debt to partially finance its entry into the Australian market.</p>
<p>Recent history has shown that brewers can be quite creative in their acquisition strategies, both in financing and the recent interest in terms of joint acquisitions and equity deals. Private equity operators' recent interest in brewers could also add a new element to the list of potential acquirers as they look to expand. Foster's high market share, margins and the lack of available alternatives all  make the company's beer business a very appealing proposition, which should attract a variety of bidders, however the wine business might well be split up.</p>

<p>South Africa's black middle-classes, referred to as 'the black diamonds', have been sparkling since the end of apartheid. They were largely excluded from the economy during the dark years. Thanks to the “affirmative action” among other measures, they managed to break through the poverty barrier, being the first generation of their families to get a foot in the middle-income bracket. They now represent a strong economic bloc of more than three million people, whose average monthly income has more than doubled in 15 years, reaching that of their white counterparts. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>'Black diamonds' strong inclination towards aspirational goods continues to boost sales of premium products, particularly beer</h3>
<p>Their strong penchant for conspicuous consumption largely drove sales of premium international products during the economic boom until 2008. The black diamonds tend to spend lavishly on aspirational goods, such as expensive cars, clothes and cosmetics, to show off their wealth and social status. This can be considered their revenge on the years of apartheid. Historically, products destined particularly for black South Africans were poorly made and very cheap. As a result, this consumer group dislikes mass brands and associates price with quality. Research shows that their conspicuous consumption patterns remained resilient to the economic recession in 2009, when GDP dropped by 2%, and continued to drive sales of premium products, particularly premium beer. </p>
<p>The alcoholic drinks industry represents a good illustration of the black middle-class inclination for premium products. With average volume growth of 10% per year since 2004, sales of premium beer continued to flourish in 2009. Despite the recession that year, sales of premium beer increased by 9% to reach 428 million litres, mainly driven by demand from black middle-income earners according to industry insiders. Even in the upmarket bars of Soweto, the sprawling township of Johannesburg, premium brands like Heineken, Amstel and SABMiller's brands are in high demand. Premium beer was estimated to account for 12% of total beer sales in South Africa in 2009.</p>
<h3>Heineken increasingly challenging SABMiller in the premium segment </h3>
<p>Heineken is increasingly taking on the beer giant SABMiller and gaining share in the premium beer segment. To exploit the growth opportunities in the South African premium beer segment, the Dutch manufacturer recently opened a R3.5 billion brewery in Sedibeng, south of Johannesburg, co-owned with Diageo. The new brewery is mainly concerned with manufacturing premium brands, including Amstel, Heineken and Windhoek, for the local market. According to company insiders, strong demand from the black middle-classes for premium beer justifies this decision, and is expected to continue to fuel sales over the forecast period.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are also increasingly focusing on black South Africans in their advertising campaigns. Heineken, for example, is investing heavily in marketing which is targeted at this growing consumer segment. The company is currently producing a new television talent show called 'Class Act', in which the Amstel logo is prominent. In the show, contestants compete in a series of acting challenges, hoping to win a trip to New York and a starring role in an Amstel beer commercial. The first episode was seen by more than three million South Africans. Heineken's Amstel brand also features prominently in the popular soap opera 'Generations', which focuses on a successful black middle-class family in Johannesburg. Through its campaigns, Heineken hopes to portray its products as aspirational brands and tap into the growing demand for premium beer.</p>
<h3>Wine to emulate beer's strategy</h3>
<p>It is worth mentioning that premium beer is currently growing at the expense of other premium drinks, particularly wine. Unlike beer, the wine category is not investing significant amounts in advertising, and is hence failing to attract additional consumers. To reverse this trend, wine players will need to increase their focus on the black diamonds, particularly on black women who have shown a strong penchant for sophisticated products. </p>

Baltika expands into soft drinks to ease reliance on beer,Baltika's string of new launches provides another example of a brave and confident FMCG player venturing into unfamiliar categories which may then be built up as a new source for long-term growth.,"<p>Baltika's string of new launches provides another example of a brave and confident FMCG player venturing into unfamiliar categories which may then be built up as a new source for long-term growth.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Baltika, Carlsberg's subsidiary in Russia, is quickly expanding into the soft drinks and cider businesses in the face of the sluggishness of the beer market. The company has launched new non-beer brands Life Spring Water, Granary Land 7 Grains kvass and Crazy lemonade. The latest arrival is low-alcohol Somersby cider. The Russian cider market is still in its infancy and so Baltika is testing the waters and attempting to gain first-mover advantage. Euromonitor International believes that Baltika's expansion into soft drinks could ease its reliance on beer, providing it with a new source of growth given the company's strong production and extensive distribution capabilities. Nevertheless, this remains something of a risk as most Russian companies are still struggling given the country's poor economic climate. Baltika will need considerable vision and financial strength if it is to successfully diversify into a new beverage category.</p>
<h2>The situation</h2>
<p>Baltika is Russia's leading beer maker, commanding a 40% volume share of sales in 2009. Beer is Baltika's core product. According to Euromonitor International, in the non-beer market, carbonates are the company's key products, generating retail value sales of US$12 million in 2009. The company has 11 non-beer brands. However, the combined sales of these brands remain minimal in terms of total revenue, meaning revenue from its non-beer portfolio is not sufficient enough to offset its flagging beer sales. Baltika's over-dependence on its beer business makes it highly vulnerable to the changing operating environment and trading conditions in Russia. Baltika may not have the power to influence the external climate but it can seek to change its product strategy and respond to the challenges by adjusting its product lines. </p>
<p>Specifically, the severe recession resulted in a 7% drop in beer sales for Baltika in 2009, according to Euromonitor International. In addition, the situation worsened when the Russian government recently increased the tax on beer by 200%, making retail prices of beer even more expensive than soft drinks. Prior to the tax hike, a bottle of standard Baltika beer cost RUB19.90 per half litre and RUB29.80 for the same amount of Coca-Cola, according to Euromonitor International's field researcher. Cash-strapped Russian consumers are turning away from beer to other beverages such as soft drinks. Culturally, Russians are heavy spirits consumers and beer is not considered “an alcoholic drink” but a soft drink due to its low alcohol content. The government is planning to limit the distribution of beer in small stores, which could prove devastating to the likes of Baltika.</p>
<h2>The vision</h2>
<p>Baltika states that “beer will continue to be the key sector for our business. At the same time, this launch is in complete accordance with Baltika's strategy, aimed at diversifying our brand portfolio. Having products in different categories in our portfolio makes us less dependent on the situation in the beer market. Producing soft drinks and other non-alcoholic products — like kvass and bottled water — we are substantially expanding the potential target audience for our products, and opening new long-term opportunities for developing and strengthening our position in the Russian market"". Euromonitor International believes this is the right move for the long-term sustainability of the company and the massive entry into soft drinks is likely to bring value to Carlsberg's shareholders eventually.</p>
<p>In an ever changing beverage market, how to grab share of throat and share of wallet is an increasingly important issue for global strategic planners. Shareholders would be happy to see the CEO managing the company they invest in take some strategic action and offer hope for a decent return rather than wait for the situation to improve of its own accord. Of course, risks in relation to new ventures or experiments will have to be carefully monitored and managed. Going beyond one's comfort zone and venturing into new geographies and categories is exactly the right strategy for Baltika to follow now. Those companies which may have the capability to acquire or expand into new categories or geographies but do not have the vision or courage to do so may feel they have missed a golden opportunity in 10 years time. </p>
<p>It is also fairly common for FMCG companies to move into non-familiar categories. In India, United Spirits is gearing up for a push in the energy drinks market; in China, Tsingtao is selling soft drinks alongside beer; and most recently, the luxury goods player Burberry announced its intention to enter the premium cosmetics segment. Although some initiatives have not met expectations and new products have eventually been withdrawn from the market, there are plenty of successful examples for courageous strategic planners to follow. The important thing is to take into account past experience when planning future ventures. </p>
<h2>The prediction </h2>
<p>In the case of Baltika, its expansion into soft drinks is likely to be a success for several reasons. Firstly, there are Baltika breweries in 10 cities across the country, boasting a production capacity of 52 million decalitres of beer per month, although the company owns only one production facility for soft drinks at the moment. The potential transfer of production lines from beer to soft drinks may aid future ambition. The company's extensive distribution network will enable its new products to quickly get to market and target the right consumers, although Baltika does not yet have a large number of beverage coolers  in the retail channel . Large-scale raw material purchasing will also help lower production costs for its soft drinks and enable it to offer competitive retail selling prices when compared to rival brands. For example, the packaging material for beer tends to be plastic, which can also be used for soft drinks. </p>
<p>With over 10 years' experience of exporting to overseas markets, the Russian brewer has successfully managed to enter more than 60 countries worldwide. In 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 alone, Baltika expanded its distribution and began deliveries to 13 new markets. Leveraging existing operations will be the key to success for new ventures. Therefore, soft drinks should help reduce Baltika's over-reliance on beer over the medium term. </p>

In the meantime, saturation remains a thorn in the side of leading beer manufacturers that are responsible for transforming the global market into a lager drinking, one-trick pony. Within this context, dark beer is exiting the realm of obscurity on the back of a consumer quest for alternatives, while also providing some interesting prospects going forward. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Back to its roots</h3>
<p>Accounting for a meagre 5.6 billion litres in 2009, dark beer's global volumes are a drop in the ocean compared to the 173 billion litres commanded by lager. What's more, a handful of markets, namely Germany, the UK, the US, South Africa and Canada, account for more than 70% of volumes sold around the world, while at the same time reflecting nascent trends impacting the beer category across the board. </p>
<p>Dark beer's fortunes in the UK, the US and – to a lesser extent - Germany are intricately linked to the emergence of a grass roots, artisanal-inspired, home brew-oriented revival of ale and wheat beer. </p>
<p>Ale has a long history in the UK but recent events have shaped its current direction. Back in 2002, the then-Labour government introduced Progressive Beer Duty to encourage the creation of small- scale brewers in the country. Since then, the number of brewers in the UK – mostly focusing on ale and wheat beer variants - has more than doubled against a backdrop of an overall declining beer market and an economic recession that has decisively tightened access to capital. However, while this new generation of producers provided a much-needed and radically innovative boost to the category, this did not prove to be enough to stem the tide of chronic sales declines. </p>
<p>Not just yet, to be precise. Because while the dark beer category posted more than an 8% CAGR decline in total volume terms over 2004-2009, primarily due to its generic focus on the beleaguered on-trade, 2009 saw a surprise 1% increase in off-trade sales against a bleak backdrop of almost uniform declines. With key retailers now listing ale and wheat beer variants and the limitations of the on-trade largely overcome, the category appears to be rapidly recruiting a new generation of followers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the people buying into it for the first time tend to belong to a younger demographic, while the fact that they are less price-conscious means scope for bigger profit margins for manufacturers brave enough to venture into the segment. As the public's thirst for premium bottled ale remains undiminished and educational campaigns and generic bodies, such as the Campaign for Real Ale, promote it, the untapped potential is huge. And mirrored on the other side of the pond as well. </p>
<p>Amber ale, one of dark beer's most dynamic segments in the US, was the fastest growing category in the country in 2009 due to both the launch of Budweiser American Ale in late 2008 as well as due the bottom-up, home and micro-brew activity buoying the segment. The unique flavour of these products appealed to beer enthusiasts looking for a complex flavour and to premium beer novices and non-beer drinkers who do not like the taste of standard American lager. Dark beer's stratospheric growth rates did eventually cool somewhat as the entire craft beer trend slowed, although it still managed to secure impressive 4% total volume growth in 2009.</p>
<p>If in the UK and the US dark beer is taking up the mantle of a forward-looking, innovation-driven segment hinting at traditional European brewing methods, it is the country's heritage itself that is driving sales in Germany. Volume sales of wheat beer increased by over 1% to 888 million litres in 2009, cementing its position as the most popular type of dark beer among Germans with a 10% share of total beer sales, way ahead of Alt, Kölsch and other dark beer types.</p>
<p>Sales of wheat beer were especially strong in its region of origin, the southern German state of Bavaria, but continued to grow in other German regions as well as more and more Germans enjoyed the milder taste and slightly higher alcohol content compared to pilsener.</p>
<h3>Sorghum-rooted optimism</h3>
<p>While dark beer is witnessing a resurgence, focusing primarily on a small number of mature Western markets, it is in Africa that one of its guises is presenting a truly revolutionary proposition. In South Africa, leading beer manufacturer SABMiller is focusing on improving the image of lower-end dark beer brands to make them more aspirational, commercial offerings. </p>
<p>The company is actively increasing the use of locally grown crops such as sorghum and cassava and using them to produce more affordable brands along the same lines as the successful sorghum-based Ugandan Eagle brand. In doing so, the company is also providing economic opportunities for local farmers, while already reaping the benefits of its investment. Posting more than 4% total volume growth in 2009, sorghum beer has already established a solid footing in the South African market, while the sustainability initiatives surrounding its production could be the template for a paradigm shift in beer production and consumption in developing markets around the world. </p>
<p>Euromonitor International expects dark beer to post a 1% total volume CAGR over 2009-2014. From economy-oriented offerings in Africa to higher-end, heritage-embracing propositions in Western markets, the future for dark beer looks bright indeed. </p>

Little change in the global beer company rankings…for now.,"The global rankings for the top five brewers remain unchanged in the 2010 rankings, with many companies struggling in what are still difficult times in many regions, notably Western Europe, North America and Eastern Europe. ","<p>The global rankings for the top five brewers remain unchanged in the 2010 rankings, with many companies struggling in what are still difficult times in many regions, notably Western Europe, North America and Eastern Europe. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>A-B InBev in 2010 is projected to perform very well, with only it out of the top four global brewers seeing any organic growth, albeit of just 1%. All the other three leading players saw organic volume decline. SABMiller will see a decline of less than 1%, but Heineken, excluding its FEMSA acquisition, is expected to see a 3% decline (and in line with the company's third quarter results) in volumes a similar level to fourth placed Carlsberg. </p>
<p>A-B InBev's growth is testament to its global reach where strong performance in key emerging markets such as Brazil and China, mitigated weak performances in the struggling regions of Eastern and Western Europe and North America. This was further helped by the divestment of many of its assets in Eastern Europe to StarBev, thus reducing its exposure to many declining Eastern European markets.</p>
<p>In second place, SABMiller's virtually flat volumes were thanks to a strong performance in the Middle East and Africa, and while it suffered in Eastern Europe and the US, its limit exposure to the Western European market helped it greatly, allowing volumes to remain flat.</p>
<p>Both Heineken's and Carlsberg's declines were due to their over reliance on Eastern and Western European markets. Heineken's decline has been mitigated slightly by its large presence in the Middle East and Africa and to a lesser extent Carlsberg in Asia-Pacific. </p>
<h3>Is change afoot?</h3>
<p>If one was to include acquisitions, however, Heineken should see growth of 32% thanks to its acquisition of FEMSA in early 2010. The deal has put Heineken within 0.8 percentage points (1.4bn litres) of SABMiller in second place. It will be interesting to see whether the gap between the two narrows further, especially with limited acquisition targets globally. </p>
<p>Both companies have similar regional presences, in terms of emerging markets with strong presences in Latin America, Middle East & Africa and Eastern Europe while in mature western markets, SABMiller has a strong presence in the US and is relatively weak in Western Europe. For Heineken the position is reversed.  Much will depend on the individual company's ability to exploit growth and mitigate declines as appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition there may well be changes lower down the rankings, with Carlsberg falling out to the top four in 2011, being replaced by the local Chinese giant China Resources. With the majority of Carlsberg's volumes in the poor performing Western and Eastern European regions it will struggle to see much growth. In contrast, China Resources has seen growth of over a billion litres a year in 2009 and is projected to do the same in 2010 and thus moved to within 0.5 percentage points of Carlsberg. Despite this impending change, Carlsberg will still remain the fourth biggest brewer by value sales, due to the low margins of China Resources brands.</p>
<p>With potential acquisitions limited by number, size and ownership issues (dependent on whether the existing owners want to sell) most company growth will be organic in the future. Thus companies with strong presences in fast growing markets in Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa and Latin America such as China, Brazil and Nigeria are likely to perform best. Although growth will be enhanced by the leading companies' ability to mitigate decline in poor performing countries and regions or by taking share for dominant players in these markets, such as Heineken in South Africa and SABMiller in the UK. Interesting and challenging times lie ahead.   </p>

New global report: Growth opportunities for beer suppliers,"The balance between production and consumption is sensitive and influenced by many factors.

Undersupply can result in price increases and oversupply can result in lower prices, which can undermine consumer confidence in brand equity and be harmful to brewers' profits. Is there a degree of market equilibrium in beer? Which markets top the rankings when it comes to beer production, imports and exports? In this latest global briefing, Euromonitor International investigates the growth opportunities for beer suppliers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In addition to providing an overview of global beer production, and how production both influences and is influenced by general market performance, the report features a case study on China. China is the largest and one of the most dynamic beer markets in the world. This report will attempt to shed light on how to reap the benefits from this lucrative market, forecast to generate over 50% of absolute beer volume growth over 2010-2015. Alongside this, Euromonitor International will attempt to identify key opportunities for brewing companies not only within beer but also within adjacent drinks categories, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The report will also focus on the most interesting geographic opportunities for global brewers and provide insight into how these players can best leverage market opportunities within them. Finally, this report is designed to provide strategic insight into when it is most appropriate to produce beer locally, within the geography for which consumption is intended, or brewing abroad and then exporting to that market. Both strategies can prove beneficial. The key is determining which is most strategically advantageous to maximising sales prospects based on local market conditions at a given point in time.</p>
<h3>Key findings include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Compared to wine or whisky, beer production does not require much lead time and allows brewers to react to any changes in demand relatively quickly. As such, global beer supply generally meets demand and maintains a degree of equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In general, beer operates in a “local global” market, with the majority of beer being consumed where it is produced. Imports and exports only account for a very small proportion of worldwide beer production, less than 10% on average.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Large markets for imported beer, such as the US, exist thanks to consumer preferences rather than necessity. Instead of making up for any shortfalls in local production, beer is generally imported to create an upscale cachet lacking from most domestic brews.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This means that for brewers the decision to continue exporting or to produce locally depends on volume sales prospects, the company's overall strategy, how a specific brand is positioned and the existing operational resources in a particular country.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Looking at markets as varied as saturated Germany to dynamic China, brewers are facing numerous and constant challenges. This makes effective and strategically focused supply chain management even more imperative to global success.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>China is both the largest beer producer and consumer in the world by absolute volumes. However, per capita consumption remains low, meaning there is still considerable room for domestic and international brewers to grow significantly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Local production is the best way for multinational brewers to remain competitive in lucrative emerging markets such as China, Brazil and India. A local presence can help cut costs and prices and enable brewers to better and more quickly tap into new market opportunities.</li>

Global Alcoholic Drinks Projections 2011 - Part 1: Alcoholic Drinks and Beer,"If last year's projections on the future of the global alcoholic drinks industry were an exercise in cautious optimism amidst still hostile and fluid socio-economic and operating environments, the arrival of the much-vaunted - and partly disputed - recovery is only raising fresh questions regarding its nature, sustainability and momentum. Nevertheless, crises can sometimes have a cathartic effect, essentially accelerating underlying trends and playing the role of harbingers of change. Within thi","<p>If last year's projections on the future of the global alcoholic drinks industry were an exercise in cautious optimism amidst still hostile and fluid socio-economic and operating environments, the arrival of the much-vaunted - and partly disputed - recovery is only raising fresh questions regarding its nature, sustainability and momentum. Nevertheless, crises can sometimes have a cathartic effect, essentially accelerating underlying trends and playing the role of harbingers of change. Within this context, China, the off-trade's relative resilience in the face of the on-trade's demise and widening discrepancies in the alcoholic drinks industry's performance in mature versus emerging markets are themes that not only dominated headlines over the past year but are also expected to dictate developments over the short to medium term.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>The Chinese influence</h3>
<p>China's unquenchable thirst is not only playing a major part in the direction the global alcoholic drinks industry is taking but has come to be its primary driver and most important market. The performance of ascending Chinese brands and companies, as well as key manufacturers' investments, underline the fact that the country's formidable influence over the alcoholic drinks industry will only tighten further. A rapidly expanding middle-class, rampant fascination with Western drinking habits and a consistent shift towards higher-end varietals will only make China's influence more prominent as traditional alcoholic drinks bastions such as the US, the UK and Japan continue to stagnate.</p>
<h3>A tale of two worlds</h3>
<p>The improving top-line global alcoholic drinks figures mask widening discrepancies between the industry's performance in emerging and mature markets; a sharp bounce back for the former contrasts with stagnating growth for the latter. Moving forward, the theme is expected to gather further momentum as Western Europe and North America's forecast lacklustre performance will shift the spotlight towards emerging nations, primarily the BRICs, Asia Pacific and Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<h3>The on-/off-trade conundrum </h3>
<p>According to Euromonitor International's latest findings, both off- and on-trade sales witnessed a relative resurgence during 2010, although this should not be taken as an all-clear sign. The Russian influence, where massive tax spikes transformed the on-trade into a value-for-money proposition in relative terms, and the 'going out' buoyancy of emerging nations, spearheaded by China, skew the global data. However, the on-trade is still suffering in Western markets and forecast short to medium-term growth is bound to be anaemic at best. The introduction of severe cuts, austerity measures, additional taxes and redundancies in a large number of Western nations does not bode well for discretionary spending and post-recessionary going out habits. Although it has to be stressed that the on-trade's travails in Western markets actually preceded the recession, the alcoholic drinks industry is not out of the woods and it will be some time before Western consumers return to frequenting bars as often as they did before the recession. </p>
<h3>Polarisation: extremes appeal</h3>
<p>If premiumisation was the offspring of the boom years, polarisation and its dual focus on higher-end as well as economy variants will shape the global alcoholic drinks market in the near future. Affordability credentials will gain further traction and take many forms; from larger pack sizes to private label launches, trading down is the answer to the dawn of the era of frugality. That is not to say that the premium segment will necessarily suffer as it will still appeal to upper-income groups willing to indulge and aspiring middle-class consumers. Nevertheless, standard products will be squeezed from both sides. </p>
<h3>Beer: Small brewers of the world unite</h3>
<p>Microbreweries and craft beers will continue to rewrite the rulebook. As mainstream beer brands face a toxic mix of maturity, saturation, unfavourable demographics and consumer retrenchment in austerity-gripped Western markets, boutique, small batch offerings will be the industry's last defence against plummeting sales. Small-scale, independent and experimental producers will pave the way for the multinationals to follow. </p>
<h3>Going light</h3>
<p>Low ABV, low calorie and low carbohydrate content will increasingly enter the mainstream. Diametrically opposite to the full-flavoured, often stronger microbrewery offerings, light varietals are primarily spearheading brewing behemoths' attempts to lure female audiences as well as increasingly health-aware young male urbanites. At the same time, low ABV products will provide an essential corporate responsibility halo in the face of increasingly prohibitionist rhetoric dominating public discourse.</p>
<h3>Beer companies to watch</h3>
<p>Following the peak of activity in 2008 and 2009, 2011, like 2010, is likely to be another quiet year. This will be due to a combination of most of the major brewers still needing to repair their balance sheets as well as a lack of available major targets. The exception to the former is SABMiller and the exception to the latter is Foster's Group's beer operations Carlton & United Breweries. </p>
<p>The two would certainly make a good fit, with Australia a fast growing and key target market for SABMiller. Even though Molson Coors seems to have pulled out of the running following the divestment of its stake in Foster's Group, SABMiller is likely to face stiff competition from the major Japanese brewers Asahi and Suntory as they look to expand outside their low-margin and low-growth domestic market. Japanese companies have a growing presence in the country in other categories such as soft drinks, where Kirin and Asahi are major players. Following its acquisition of Lion Nathan in 2009, Kirin is now the country's second biggest brewer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, acquisitions in the brewing industry are likely to be limited due to the factors mentioned in the opening paragraph. One interesting trend which started in 2010 was companies moving into rivals' core territories, such as SABMiller with its Isenbeck acquisition in Argentina (a core market for A-B InBev) in late 2010. The next possible target market for such a move could be Brazil, which has a number of reasonably sized private companies which would be tempting targets, not just for SABMiller but also a company like Modelo, which has expressed an interest in expanding into Brazil amongst other markets.</p>
<p>One other company worth watching could be the world's second biggest cider producer C&C Group, seeing for how long it can remain independent. It would be no surprise to have seen it swallowed up by one of the big two brewers, A-B InBev or SABMiller, by the end of 2011. Cider is already offering significant premium growth in markets such as the UK and has the potential to do the same in North America. This offers brewers the opportunity to grow volume and value sales in declining or slow growing beer markets. Achieving this, particularly in the US, will require substantial support. This is something C&C Group cannot offer. Of the big two brewers, A-B InBev is undoubtedly the favourite despite its high debt as the purchase would be relatively small and SABMiller's focus is likely to be elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Beer brands to watch</h3>
<p>Budweiser is a brand that is worth continuing to watch. Despite global volumes posting a decline, when excluding its main US market the brand has actually seen some good growth. Whether that was due to the football World Cup effect or A-B InBev getting to grips with the brand will at least in part become apparent in 2011.</p>
<p>Another interesting one to watch is the leading brand in Eastern Europe, Carlsberg's Baltika. Having seen rapid growth up until 2008 thanks to its booming home market, Russia, the brand has been in decline as the Russian market has struggled due to tax hikes. Although Baltika had already started to export its eponymous brand to other markets, 2010 has seen a more dramatic increase in pushing the brand internationally in order to mitigate declines in its core market. The key focus during 2010 has been emerging markets, notably the Middle East and Africa and Latin America. The impact in the short term at least will be relatively small, especially as Carlsberg currently lacks distribution muscle in many of these regions. However, it is interesting to see how a formerly rapidly growing emerging market brand is now looking to exports to drive growth.</p>

<p>The new data can be found under Food Production in the database. Data on the production of beer is available for 155 countries for the years 1977-2011. The production of beer refers to a beverage that may be alcoholic or non-alcoholic that is made from fermented malted cereals (mainly barley), water and hops. Non-malted cereals may also be used. The FAO definition differs from the main international classifications in that it includes non-alcoholic beer. </p>
<p>Wine production covers 68 countries for the years 1977-2011, and refers to wines of fresh grapes of all qualities, including sparkling, fortified and dessert wines. </p>

A-B InBev Extends Its Footprint in China with the Acquisition of Weixue Beer Group,"A-B InBev, the leading brewer in the world, has announced that it is to acquire Weixue Beer Group Co in Henan province, China. This is A-B InBev's second acquisition deal in the country this year, demonstrating the company's increased focus on emerging markets. In 2010, A-B InBev's performance was significantly boosted by strong volume growth in emerging markets, notably China and Brazil, while its domestic US market and most countries in Europe showed declining beer volumes. ","<p>A-B InBev, the leading brewer in the world, has announced that it is to acquire Weixue Beer Group Co in Henan province, China.

In 2010, A-B InBev's performance was significantly boosted by strong volume growth in emerging markets, notably China and Brazil, while its domestic US market and most countries in Europe showed declining beer volumes. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>China the world's largest beer consumer </h3>
<p>China is the most important beer market in the world; in 2010, beer volumes reached 45.4 billion litres in the country, accounting for 24% of total world consumption. In terms of per capita consumption, there is still room for improvement however, as Chinese consumers drank 34 litres of beer in 2010, far from the 64 litres consumed per capita in Brazil or the 151 litres consumed in the Czech Republic. Yet, global beer volumes are driven by China; according to Euromonitor International data, the market posted 6% volume growth in 2010, well above the 1% global average.</p>
<h3>A-B InBev the third largest brewer in China</h3>
<p>A-B InBev has already set up operations in the booming Chinese market; the company has 33 breweries across 13 provinces, producing 25 brands, including Budweiser, Harbin and Sedrin. It is the third largest brewer in the country, the only major international player to appear in the top five rankings. In late 2008, as per government orders, A-B InBev had to sell its 27% equity stake in China's second-ranked Tsingtao Brewery, and it is now building its business independently in the country. </p>
<p>A-B InBev's principle strength lies in North and Northeast China and South China, although the company also has a presence in Mid China, East China and Southwest China. In 2010, the company broadened its presence through building a new brewery in Sichuan province (Southwest China). In February 2011, it signed a deal to acquire full control of the Liaoning Dalian Daxue Brewery in Liaoning province, enhancing its presence in North and Northeast China, the country's largest region in terms of beer consumption, accounting for 13.3 billion litres in 2010. The acquisition of the Henan-based Weixue Beer Group Co, announced in March 2011, will strengthen A-B InBev's position in Mid China, the third largest beer region in the country, with 7.3 billion litres of beer sold in 2010, posting 5% growth. The deal gives A-B InBev access to Weixue's namesake brand and strengthens its foothold in the country, with three more breweries (in Xinyang, Zhengzhou and Gushi). In addition, A-B InBev plans to build one more brewery in the Henan region, in Xinxiang, to secure its position in Mid China, the largest region in terms of population and therefore a strategically important one for brewers.</p>
<h3>Future growth driven by China</h3>
<p>The strong beer volume growth in China is expected to continue over 2010-2015; according to Euromonitor International, the market will post a 7% volume CAGR, while global beer volumes are expected to grow by a 3% CAGR over the same period. Growth is expected to be stronger in the provinces of North and Northeast China and East China, with 7% volume CAGR increases, while Mid China is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR over 2010-2015. A-B InBev has a strong position in North and Northeast China and South China, and it has made significant efforts to strengthen its position in Mid China; thus it is well placed to exploit future growth and reinforce its leading global position. </p>
<p>A-B InBev's expansion strategy in Mid China marks a trend, as other major brewers are also trying to extend their geographic presence in the region. The leading player China Resources, in which SABMiller has a 49% equity stake, opened a new brewery in Henan province in 2010, and Beijing Yanjing Brewery, the third biggest Chinese brewer, has acquired a 90% equity stake in Henan Yueshan Brewery, setting up its first production base in the region to compete with other leading players, such as China Resources, Tsingtao and A-B InBev. </p>
<p>The Chinese market will continue to lead global beer volume growth, and it is important for all brewers to build a presence in the country, as only companies with exposure to high growth markets like China and Brazil will be able to post above-average growth going forward.</p>

<p>All major brewers are looking for ways to exploit the growth coming from China, as it is the world's largest beer market and it continues to lead global volume growth. In 2010, the Chinese beer market showed 6% volume growth, and, according to Euromonitor International data, the strong growth trend will continue at a 7% volume CAGR over 2010-2015, as a result of continued economic development, population growth and a growing middle class.</p>
<h3>Expanded beer capacity and extensive promotions</h3>
<p>China Resources' beer division reported turnover of HK$21,535 million and earnings of HK$685 million in 2010, representing year-on-year increases of 14.1% and 26.9% respectively. Total volume sales of beer rose by 11% in 2010 to approximately 9.3 billion litres. </p>
<p>China Resources has been building a strong network in China; the company extended its equity stakes in several breweries in 2010 (it acquired a 10% remaining stake in CRB Binzhou, a 27% stake in CR Snow Zhejiang, and a 45% stake in Xihu beer), took over Aoke Beer, and opened a new brewery in Henan province. At the end of 2010, the company operated 72 breweries, with a presence in 21 out of the 34 regions in China and an annual production capacity of more than 14.5 billion litres.</p>
<p>China Resources' beer volumes were significantly boosted by the leading brand, Snow, which saw its volumes increase by 16% to approximately 8.4 billion litres in 2010, accounting for more than 90% of the company's total beer sales. By enhancing the product mix and selling prices in certain regions, the company's average selling price and gross margin both increased during the year under review. </p>
<p>Besides beer, other core businesses also performed strongly in 2010; the company's retail division achieved significant growth, with earnings climbing by 22% on continuing expansion, while its food division recorded an increase in underlying net profit of 40% on the back of strong brand recognition. The beverages division achieved a robust increase in turnover of 31% mainly due to strong growth in sales volume. Mr Chen Lang, Chief Executive Officer of the company, said, “The Group's sound performance in 2010 has validated our efforts to move steadily toward the goal of becoming the largest consumer goods company in China”.</p>
<h3>Everyone wants to be in China</h3>
<p>China is the largest beer market in the world; with 45.4 billion litres of beer sold, it accounted for 24% of global consumption in 2010. Although the market is dominated by local players, all major brewers are trying to gain share in the booming economy. The global leader A-B InBev, which ranks third in the country, has been building its own operations since it was obligated to sell its stake in the second ranked Chinese player, Tsingtao. The company owns 33 breweries in the country and extended its presence in early 2011 through the acquisition of Weixue Beer Group. Carlsberg has a 17.5% holding in Chongqing Brewery, while SABMiller enjoys the gains of its large equity stake in China Resources, which leads the Chinese beer market with a 21% volume share. </p>
<p>China Resources is expected to continue to post a good performance in the forecast period, capitalising on the strong growth and its extensive presence in the market. However, China is expected to remain an attractive and strategically important market for international brewers as well. Although the market is still dominated by low-margin economy lager, as disposable incomes and the proportion of the urban population increase, this will boost currently relatively small premium lager volumes. These accounted for just 3% of total beer volumes in 2010, compared to a 20% share of beer sales in the US, but while US premium lager volumes are expected to grow by 205 million litres over 2010-2015 (1% CAGR), Chinese volumes are estimated to increase by 1,188 million litres over the same period (15% CAGR). Thus, the country offers value growth possibilities, another reason for brewers to establish and extend their presence in China. </p>

SABMiller Needs to Expand to Negate Weak Beer Performances in Europe and the Americas,"SABMiller's broad geographic spread allowed the company to report 2% volume growth in fiscal 2011 (year to March). Strong growth in its Asia, Africa and South Africa regions more than negated weak performances in its Europe and two American regions. Although if equity volumes from its global total, in other words its stakes in Castel and in particular China Resources, are stripped out, the company actually saw its volumes decline slightly. ","<p>SABMiller's broad geographic spread allowed the company to report 2% volume growth in fiscal 2011 (year to March). Strong growth in its Asia, Africa and South Africa regions more than negated weak performances in its Europe and two American regions. Although if equity volumes from its global total, in other words its stakes in Castel and in particular China Resources, are stripped out, the company actually saw its volumes decline slightly. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>SABMiller's largest region by volume based on Euromonitor definition, is Middle East and Africa, (Africa and South Africa combined) drove company growth, thanks to the company returning to growth in its largest market South Africa and strong growth in a number of sub-Saharan markets such as Uganda, Angola and Mozambique. In a number of these markets, such as Angola, growth was driven by expanding production and distribution facilities. </p>
<p>With Heineken seeing strong growth in Middle East and Africa as well in 2010, albeit in different countries, it emphasises the strong growth prospects for the region. Euromonitor International forecasts that beer volume sales will grow by a 6% CAGR (4.6 billion litres) between 2010-2015. </p>
<p>The other strong growth area for the company was Asia Pacific, where, primarily thanks to SABMiller's 49% stake in China Resources (excluded from Euromonitor International's volumes for the company and accounting for around 80% of the company's reported volumes in the region), the company saw 11% volume growth. Excluding China  and its China Resources joint venture, the company did well in the region, with volumes seeing double-digit growth during the fiscal year thanks to strong growth in India.</p>
<h3>Struggling to record growth in other regions</h3>
<p>Yet, in all of SABMiller's other regions, namely Europe (primarily Eastern Europe), Latin America and North America, the company saw its volumes decline or stagnate. </p>
<p>In North America, SABMiller's second largest market by volume, its MillerCoors distribution joint venture performed no differently from its major rival A-B InBev, with both suffering volume declines due to category maturity. </p>
<p>In Europe, the company continued to suffer from being present in a number of declining and struggling markets, primarily in Eastern Europe. The company was not alone, with many of its competitors, such as Heineken and Carlsberg, suffering similar declines. The only bright spots in the region were the UK and Ukraine, with both seeing double-digit growth, albeit from small bases and, more surprisingly, Russia, where the company saw 1% volume growth in fiscal 2011. This slight growth came from a strong focus on the economy beer segment as consumers traded down. </p>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>While declines in Europe and North America are of little surprise, SABMiller's stagnating performance in Latin America is more concerning and shows that, even in emerging markets, the company needs to broaden its geographic spread. Its stagnant performance was in contrast to the region's beer volume growth of 2%  in 2010, according to Euromonitor International.</p>
<p>SABMiller's flat sales were thanks to falling volumes, due to a rise in VAT, in its largest market in Latin America, Colombia, which accounted for 45% of the company's regional volumes in 2010  according to Euromonitor. It was only strong growth in its second biggest market, Peru, that countered the decline. </p>
<h3>Acquisitions still required</h3>
<p>To reduce the risk of the continued weak performances, SABMiller needs to broaden its geographic spread in Latin America, moving to the southern part of the region and, in particular, to Brazil. The company has already started to do this with its acquisition of Warsteiner's operations in Argentina in late 2010. Yet, it still needs to do more, and, with Brazil's second biggest player, Schincarol, apparently up for sale, it should make a strong push for the company in the region's fastest growing market.</p>
<p>Latin America should not be the only region SABMiller looks to to broaden its geographic spread. The company should and already has been looking to do the same in Africa, with investment in production and distribution infrastructure in a number of countries, as well as rumoured interest in gaining a majority stake in Castel's beer operations. Whilst benefitting from strong growth in China and India, the company needs to look to expand more in Asia Pacific to broaden its portfolio. </p>

Burgers and Beer: A New Trend in U.S. Fast Food?,"With the goal of driving evening traffic and appealing to a wider range of potential customers, fast food operators have started testing beer and wine in U.S. restaurants.","<p>With the goal of driving evening traffic and appealing to a wider range of potential customers, fast food operators have started testing beer and wine in U.S. restaurants.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>The continuing lag in consumer spending has resulted in operators taking steps to drive traffic and increase average checks. Some have opted to remodel restaurants or increase beverage menus, while others have tried to capitalize on weak dayparts through enhanced breakfast menus and snack items. It's a bold move and a clear departure from traditional fast food culture, but serving beer and wine may provide an opportunity to attain both goals with the added bonus of boosting profits through higher margins. It comes at a price, though: Adding alcohol will affect branding, and some family-friendly operators may not want to take the risk.</p>
<h2>Attracting the dinner crowd</h2>
<p>Beer, wine, and fast food isn't an entirely innovative concept. First-mover Yum! Brands began offering beer at 100% home delivery/takeaway Pizza Huts in April, 2009, and Burger King's upscale Whopper Bar concept has been expanding quietly since later that year. Situated in popular tourist locations like Miami's South Beach and New York City's Times Square, the concept was designed to compete with casual dining chains and appeal to a more mature demographic. Sonic Restaurants also recently announced two of the company's locations would start selling beer and wine in efforts to increase evening traffic. In 2010, only 17% of Sonic's value sales occurred during the after-dinner daypart, and in June, company executives reported that evenings were the chain's softest daypart in its most recent quarter. </p>
<p>In perhaps the most surprising development, Starbucks recently began serving beer and wine in two Seattle test locations for a de-branded “neighbourhood cafe” concept. Evidenced by the fact that 70% of sales currently take place before 2 p.m., the evening daypart has always eluded the chain, despite attempts at happy hour promotions and afternoon “Treat Receipt” discounts.</p>
<p>Some might say three major players makes a trend, but there are a few reasons why this niche development may never go mainstream. Serving alcohol is a powerful branding message, and those that feel beer strengthens their existing position may see the branding and other benefits as a win-win scenario. Fast-casual chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, for example, has been successful in using alcohol as a branding tool. The chain serves margaritas and Mexican beers, reinforcing its positioning and adding appeal for its adult demographic. </p>
<p>Other operators whose branding clashes with the alcohol message, however, may be hesitant to make the change, despite any potential benefits. The easiest example of this is McDonald's which, despite having served alcohol in select overseas markets for years, seems unlikely to be bringing beer-and-Big-Mac combos to the U.S. anytime soon. One of McDonald's' major U.S. strategic initiatives in recent years has been adding healthier menu items (think premium salads and smoothies) that appeal to moms whose kids are already drawn in by Happy Meals and other core items. Offering extremely fast service is also one of McDonald's strengths, and the logistics that go along with serving alcohol—checking identification, etc.—don't pair well with convenience. U.S. regulations also make getting liquor licenses both difficult and expensive, and the costs for such a large chain might outweigh any potential benefits.</p>
<h3>New competition for a struggling sector</h3>
<p>That said, there are benefits to serving alcohol that go beyond simple boosts to traffic and margins. This development has even greater implications, namely that fast food chains may be able to use it to better compete with full-service restaurants. While U.S. full-service restaurants currently comprise a US$184 billion industry, the sector has stagnated over the past three years, falling in value sales faster than all other categories with the exception of self-service cafeterias. During the recession, restaurants industry-wide suffered as consumers opted to trade down to less expensive options, ate out less, or stopped eating out altogether. Now consumers are starting to spend again, but they're still prioritising value. With the addition of alcohol, fast food restaurants can reposition themselves as an alternative to casual dining restaurants—one with lower prices and a comparable evening dining experience.</p>
<p>One potential pitfall to this plan is the amount of alcohol being purchased by American consumers is actually declining. The total volume of alcoholic beverages sold in the U.S. has decreased 3% since 2008, and the total volume of on-trade alcoholic beverages sold declined 7% during the same period. However, similar to the way fast food has benefited from trade-down during the recession, those consumers who do wish to enjoy alcoholic beverages with their meals may be attracted to the idea of doing so at less cost. If fast food operators can offer consumers a beer and a burger of similar quality to those served at casual dining chains, they'll stand a real chance of drawing some of the US$83 billion currently claimed by the higher-priced sub-sector.</p>
<p>In sum, adding alcohol is expensive, and it may not be an attractive option for those operators who have positioned their restaurants as family friendly. For those concepts whose key demographics are a bit older and who can seamlessly incorporate alcohol into their branding, however, alcohol serves as a valuable opportunity to increase top and bottom lines, sharpen competitive positioning, and appeal to a large pool of new potential customers.</p>

"Foster’s, a Large-Scale Acquisition Target in the Consolidated Beer Market – Part 1: The Leading Brewer in the High-Margin Australian Beer Market","Since Australia's leading brewer, Foster's, announced the demerger of its beer and wine operations in May 2010, there has been much speculation about which company will take over the company's beer division. SABMiller was the first global player that made a public offer for the Australian business, but the Foster's board believed that the A$11.2 billion proposal significantly undervalued the company. ","<p>Since Australia's leading brewer, Foster's, announced the demerger of its beer and wine operations in May 2010, there has been much speculation about which company will take over the company's beer division. SABMiller was the first global player that made a public offer for the Australian business, but the Foster's board believed that the A$11.2 billion proposal significantly undervalued the company. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>With mergers and acquisitions marking the last decade, the global beer market has become more consolidated; thus, there are very few acquisition targets left, especially large-scale ones like Foster's, and a takeover of the Australian brewer could impact the global competitive landscape. </p>
<h3>Business restructuring and demerger</h3>
<p>Over 2006-2010, Foster's Group experienced falling volumes in both beer and wine, but, while its beer arm managed to increase revenue and profitability, the company's wine operations were severely impacted by oversupply in the Australian market, which led to the devaluation of Australian wines and continuous discounting in the company's main US and UK markets as well. The declining profitability of Foster's wine business severely hit the company's overall performance, and, following an extensive strategic review, Foster's decided to demerge the two businesses. The demerger, which was finalised in May 2011, has removed the previous barrier of the attached wine business from potential buyers and is strongly expected to attract takeover interest for both Foster's wine and beer operations. However, prior to SABMiller's offer, there was only private equity interest in the company's wine business, but this public offer could encourage other potential bidders to make a move. </p>
<h3>Foster's in the Australian beer market</h3>
<p>Foster's beer arm, Carlton & United Breweries (CUB), is a relatively small global player, with annual sales of around one billion litres, but the company is the leading brewer in its domestic Australian market. The company has a limited international presence, as it has sold the selling rights for its main Foster's brand in key international markets. CUB's profitability, however, is pretty strong; the company has a 38% EBIT margin, which puts it in the premier league of global brewing. </p>
<p>CUB's main strength is in standard lager, which, despite falling volumes, remains the largest category in Australia, accounting for 67% of total beer volumes in 2010. Despite falling overall beer volumes, the Australian market has shown a strong premiumisation trend in the past few years; Kirin Holding's Toohey's, Foster's' Crown Lager and Pure Blonde, and international brands from SABMiller, Heineken and A-B InBev all registered double-digit growth in 2010 in Australia. So, even though the Australian beer market does not offer strong volume growth possibilities, there is an opportunity for value growth. </p>
<p>Foster's is an ideal target for brewers looking to expand their presence in Australia, taking advantage of the company's dominant position and wide distribution network. Although the Australian beer market is expected to continue to register overall volume declines, the premium lager segment is expected to continue to grow over 2010-2015. Moreover, Foster's is the leading player in cider/perry, which may still be a niche segment in Australia, but the category showed strong growth in the past five years and is expected to grow further at a 28% volume CAGR over 2010-2015. </p>
<p>The Australian beer market might not be the most attractive market for brewers, but Foster's, the largest acquisition target in the beer market, represents a rare opportunity. The combination of its strong domestic presence and the premiumisation trend seen in the market offer growth possibilities; thus, major beer companies need to consider the pros and cons of a possible takeover, and also the impact if one of their closest competitors acquires the Australian brewer. </p>

SABMiller was the first to make a public offer for Foster's, and this might encourage other players to make a move as well.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Global leaders focus on emerging markets</h3>
<p>Global leader A-B InBev has mainly been focusing on emerging markets. The company has been pursuing an expansion strategy in China to capitalise on the world's fastest growing market, but it already holds a dominant position in the second largest beer market, Brazil, which places it in a good position for future growth. In 2010, according to Euromonitor International, the company had a firm 19% share of global beer volumes, nearly twice as much as second-ranked SABMiller. A-B InBev does not have production facilities in Australia; its main Beck's and Budweiser brands are distributed under licence by Lion Nathan, while Stella Artois is produced locally by Foster's. Although acquiring Foster's would provide local assets and distribution for the company, given Australia's small size and declining beer consumption, it might not fit with the company's growth strategy. However, the company has a 50% non-controlling stake in the leading Mexican brewer, Grupo Modelo, which seems to be interested in the Australian brewer. </p>
<p>Grupo Modelo mainly concentrates on its domestic market, and, despite its volumes declining in 2010, the company held onto its seventh position in the global ranking. Despite a domestic decline, exports of Corona Extra have been growing continuously, encouraging Grupo Modelo to diversify its business. Given the company's low debt level, an acquisition would be ideal to lessen its overreliance on the Mexican market. In Australia, Foster's already imports and distributes Corona Extra, which, due to the shift towards premium products, has seen rapid growth in the country. Although Grupo Modelo has the financial means to consider an offer for Foster's, this would be the company's first large-scale acquisition. According to the latest news, the company was exploring the possibility of a joint bid with Molson Coors, but A-B InBev would be likely to object to such a relationship. However, the global leader might back up Grupo Modelo's bidding plan, counting on a future possibility to take over Grupo Modelo itself, thus acquiring Foster's in one step.</p>
<p>Molson Coors was considered to be one of the most likely buyers for Foster's beer arm, until it confirmed in 2010 that it would relinquish its more than 5% stake in Foster's Group. Molson Coors lost share and slipped to ninth position in the global ranking in 2010 due to its dependence on the sluggish North American and Western European markets. It is therefore looking to develop its presence in emerging markets. As the partnership with Grupo Modelo seems to have failed, Molson Coors might back away from bidding for Foster's, as it certainly does not need another mature market in which to sell beer, and it has to focus on its growth strategy to expand into emerging markets. </p>
<p>Asahi and Heineken also have limited operations in Australia, but following the FEMSA acquisition in Mexico and further expansion in Africa, Heineken has to focus on reducing its debt level, which makes its move on Foster's unlikely. Asahi, however, could challenge its nearest Japanese competitor Kirin Holdings, which held second place in beer in Australia in 2010. Foster's would match the company's strategy, as it has been strengthening its international business network, mainly focusing on the Asia/Oceania region, and its goal of increasing its overseas sales to 20-30% of total revenue by 2012. However, the company seems to be focusing more on soft drinks and its expansion in China. </p>
<h3>SABMiller the only player in the bidding battle so far</h3>
<p>SABMiller is much less exposed to developed markets than other global brewers, as, in 2010, less than 50% of its total volumes were generated in North America, Europe and Australasia. However, it is looking for expansion possibilities in these high-value markets, as it already has a strong position in Africa and Latin America. In Australia, the company has registered strong double-digit growth in the past five years, increasing its volume share to 2% by 2010. SABMiller has experience in high-scale acquisitions, and it could benefit from Foster's strong cash flow generation, and could expect significant synergies from a potential takeover. The company is likely to revise its offer and to return with a higher bid, as it has the finances to pay more than its starting offer, but, the more it does, the more difficult it will be to reap financial rewards. Foster's is a not an essential target for the company, but it probably does not want to risk missing out like it did in the case of FEMSA in 2010. Thus far, SABMiller seems to be the only player in the bidding battle. </p>
<h3>Impact on the competitive landscape</h3>
<p>Following the acquisition of Foster's – whoever the winning bidder is – consolidation is likely to continue on a much smaller scale in the beer market. In the global ranking, changes may happen, especially with the strong growth of Chinese companies, but the top three players are likely to remain the same. The acquisition of local, smaller second- or third-ranked players, like Warsteiner by SABMiller in Argentina, is expected to become prevalent in gaining entry into new markets, but major global brewers will continue to focus on developing distribution in high-growth emerging markets, and on shifting from volume to value generation in developed markets.</p>

Beer in Turkey: Branching Out,"Major brewers had been fighting an uphill battle in the vast majority of Western markets even before the crisis-induced and still ongoing fiscal maelstrom.

Turkey, a country embracing both Western aspirations and Middle Eastern conservatism, is increasingly providing one of the shortest and most straightforward exit routes from the shackles of Western European maturity and stagnation. As new product launches and resurgent company activity make waves in the consistently strong Turkish beer market, Euromonitor International takes a closer look at the category's current state and future prospects. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Booming past and solid future </h3>
<p>Total beer volumes in Turkey witnessed more than 2% growth in 2010, a significant slowdown from the 5% CAGR of the 2005-2010 review period, although still way ahead of the underwhelming Western European average. The country's geographical proximity to Europe has already captured the attention of spirits players, with Diageo establishing a strong foothold in the country through the timely acquisition of Mey Içki in February 2011. Nevertheless, spirits sales in Turkey are comparatively mature and while value growth opportunities are indeed present, it is the beer category that has been and will continue to enjoy most of the momentum stemming from recruiting young urbanites gazing westward.</p>
<p>It has not all been plain sailing, however. The belated introduction of the smoking ban in July 2009 took a toll on on-trade sales across the board, and beer was no exception. The resulting slowdown in sales through bars, clubs and restaurants proved to be only temporary, even in the face of the special consumption tax introduced in January 2010 inadvertently pushing unit prices higher. The minimum fixed tax on beer increased from TL0.26 to TL1.95, a figure that pales in comparison to the far higher increase on spirits.</p>
<p>It was within this context that beer became even more affordable in relative terms. Turkish beer drinkers were quick to adapt and proved rather resourceful and open to experimentation. Consumption shifted to the off-trade, while, with rising unit prices, the share of higher alcohol beers like Efes Xtra started to increase. Cash-strapped consumers opted to retain their overall alcohol intake at the same time as they were forced to limit their purchases. The tried and tested method of special offers and discounts also came to the rescue, providing more affordable choices through multipacks sold in major retailers. </p>
<p>While lager remains unsurprisingly the dominant category within beer in Turkey, its mostly young, adventurous and open-minded core demographic continues to be on the lookout for new drinking experiences. Niche beer categories are gradually making low key appearances without accounting for significant volumes, although surely whetting beer aficionados' appetites. Dark beer is only represented by a small number of wheat beer brands, most notably Gusta and Gusta Dark, hence still merely accounting for negligible volumes. But times are changing. </p>
<p>Brewing behemoth Anheuser-Busch InBev launched the iconic Leffe and Hoegaarden brands in Turkey in June 2011 following an import deal with Turk Tuborg Bira ve Malt Sanayii AS. As the shift away from the mature spirits category and the hunt for more affordable offerings and innovative products will continue to boost beer sales over the short to medium term, Euromonitor International expects the category to post a 3% total volume CAGR over 2010-2015. And while Anadolu Efes currently commands an impressive 83% share of the Turkish beer market, Anheuser-Busch InBev's recent move might well be the first of many to follow. After all, niche categories can still enjoy the all-important first mover advantage, providing an opportunity for multinational players to gain a foothold in the market. </p>

Following the introduction of a punitive 200% tax hike on beer and a debate involving intricate political manoeuvring, last ditch lobbying attempts and some rather dramatic volatility in the share prices of leading brewers in the country, the new 'lighter' version of the latest round of legislative amendments was eventually voted in by the State Duma at the end of July 2011. As the effects of the recent statutory offensive are still under intense scrutiny as previous attempts to curb consumption achieved dubious results at best, Euromonitor International looks into this latest in the series of unfortunate events impacting beer sales in Russia. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>The rise of neo-prohibitionary rhetoric </h3>
<p>Firstly, it is worth acknowledging the surprising resilience of the Russian beer market. It has been an uphill battle all along but the last couple of years put international brewers on a direct collision course with the inhabitants of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>A beer consumption culture was not at all developed in the USSR. However, with the advent of major international companies in the Russian beer market, consumption increased four-fold over the 1997-2007 period. And then came the legislative sea change. The bill tripling the excise tax rate on beer was passed in late 2009 and came into effect in January 2010. At the same time, the legislators decided to leave the excise tax rate on spirits with an alcohol content of above 9% unchanged until 2012. </p>
<p>The unprecedented increase could not but be reflected in the unit price of beer and expectations surrounding the market's knee-jerk reaction ranged from the sobering to the apocalyptic. In hindsight, over-pessimistic projections proved to be exactly that. Overall beer volumes in the country did witness a significant 5% drop but a double-digit collapse was easily averted, partly due to the abnormally hot weather of 2010 which provided a counterbalancing boost to the category. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, just as the beer market was starting to recover from the shock, the Kremlin decided to stem impulse buying. </p>
<h3>No reason to panic</h3>
<p>Initial drafts of the latest bill were much more hard line than the version eventually approved. Proposals included the introduction of additional licensing for beer production and compulsory excise stamps, a ban on PET bottles, a ban on selling beer in non-stationary retail outlets (kiosks), a ban on selling any alcoholic drinks (including beer) from 23.00-08.00hrs in off-trade channels, a ban on drinking alcoholic drinks (including beer) in public places and an attempt to reduce the number of beer advertising channels.</p>
<p>Discussion of the bill proved to be a painfully slow process, dragging on for more than six months. During that period brewers aggressively defended their corner. Moreover, expecting new restrictions on their products' promotion in the near future, they opted to dramatically increase their advertising budgets in 2011.</p>
<p>Following much deliberation, President Dmitry Medvedev signed the law ""On state regulation of production and turnover of ethyl alcohol and alcohol products"" in July 2011. The final signed version of the law was thankfully 'lighter' than first suggested. </p>
<p>The new bill does indeed deliver a complete ban on the retail sale of all types of alcohol, including beer, between 23.00-08.00hrs from January 2013. Additionally, the retail sale of beer in kiosks and pavilions, as well as at bus stops, open markets, railway stations, petrol stations and airports, will be prohibited at any time. On the other hand, the PET ban did not survive the vote while brewers had enough time to revamp their distribution networks and reassess their strategies, avoiding a sudden and potentially catastrophic shift in their operational models. </p>
<p>How will these legislative changes impact drinking habits and consumption patterns? Limiting selling hours will merely force Russian beer drinkers to buy in advance. However, at the end of the day, beer will still be available in the on-trade at any time. </p>
<p>The ban on consumption of beer in public places along with the ban on sales in non-stationary retail outlets (kiosks) will essentially eliminate the country's buoyant on-the-go beer consumption culture and will hence become the most painful thorn in the industry's side. Additionally, it will reduce beer consumption in regions with underdeveloped retail and potentially cut down the number of kiosks in large cities as beer accounts for the key share of their turnover. On the other hand, the new restrictions on promotion and advertising will not have a negative impact on the Russian beer market size, but rather tie the hands of leading players in their feverish attempts to gain share. </p>
<p>Initial estimates regarding projected growth rates suggest that while beer is back on a healthy footing in 2011, growth rates will indeed witness a slowdown again in 2012 and 2013 – without entering negative territory - as the new law starts to be implemented. On the other hand, and beyond this latest blip, the long-term prospects remain decidedly optimistic. The Russian alcoholic drinks market has been through tough times before and will overcome this latest legislative offensive the same way it did previous ones. </p>

Middle East and Africa: Dynamic Beer Consumption Growth Continues,"Emerging markets with strong beer volume growth have become a major focus for beer companies in recent years. Key players have been expanding their presence in Asia and Latin America, particularly in the largest Chinese and Brazilian markets, to capitalise on their dynamic volume growth, but rising beer consumption in the Middle East and Africa has also been offering growth opportunities for brewers.","<p>Emerging markets with strong beer volume growth have become a major focus for beer companies in recent years. Key players have been expanding their presence in Asia and Latin America, particularly in the largest Chinese and Brazilian markets, to capitalise on their dynamic volume growth, but rising beer consumption in the Middle East and Africa has also been offering growth opportunities for brewers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>In 2011, according to Euromonitor International estimates, beer volumes in the Middle East and Africa are expected to grow by 6%, significantly outperforming the global market which is anticipated a 2% increase. Although this strong growth comes from a relatively small base - the region accounts for only 7% of global beer volumes and per capita beer consumption currently stands at only 10 litres compared to 52 litres in Latin America and 75 litres in Eastern Europe - strong population growth and economic development are expected to continue to fuel consumption growth, thus the region offers long term opportunities.</p>
<p>In the six months to September 2011, SABMiller, the region's leading brewer, reported 6% growth in its beer volumes in Africa (excluding South Africa), while second-ranked Heineken registered 8% organic growth for its Middle East and Africa region for the first nine months. Dynamic volume growth is expected to continue. According to Euromonitor International forecasts, beer in the Middle East and Africa is set to post a 5% volume CAGR over 2011-2016, making this the world's fastest growing region. Volume growth will be driven by the region's largest South African and Nigerian markets, although other smaller markets are also expected to register dynamic growth.</p>
<p>Leading players have been working to expand their presence in the Middle East and Africa so as to take advantage of this strong growth. SABMiller already has a well-established presence in the region's largest South African market, and is enjoying strong growth elsewhere on the continent through its equity stake in Castel Group. In 2011, the company has started building a new brewery in Nigeria, challenging Heineken in its main market, while it has also announced that it will invest US$260 million in further capacity expansion in Uganda, Ghana, Zambia and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Other major brewers have also been working on strengthening their presence in the region in 2011. Heineken acquired five breweries from the Sona Group in January to strengthen its dominant position in Nigeria and also purchased the Bedele and Harar breweries from the Ethiopian government in August. Diageo is also planning to invest heavily in additional capacity to meet growing demand, and the two companies have opened a jointly-owned brewery (Sedibeng) in SABMiller's main South African market.</p>
<p>A-B InBev has not yet established a major footprint in the Middle East and Africa but should look to enter the region if it is to retain or improve its leading position globally. Due to significant acquisition activity from other players, this market has become highly consolidated, with the four largest brewers accounting for an estimated 81% of total beer volumes in 2011, and with one or two players dominating in most countries. As most of the largest acquisition targets have been taken, it will be difficult for other players to enter. Nevertheless, as the market offers strong volume growth, and with economic development driving stronger value growth, brewers should look for opportunities to grasp a share in the region.</p>

SABMiller Prepares its Premium Brands to Conquer Beer Drinkers in Australia,"Following its recent acquisition of the beer assets of Foster's Group in Australia, SABMiller has already started to increase its presence in the country. The company has announced that its Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller Chill, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell brands will join the group's Carlton United Brewers' (CUB) portfolio of international beers.","<p>Following its recent acquisition of the beer assets of Foster's Group in Australia, SABMiller has already started to increase its presence in the country. The company has announced that its Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller Chill, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell brands will join the group's Carlton United Brewers' (CUB) portfolio of international beers.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Premiumisation has been a major trend in Australia in recent years. Although overall beer consumption has declined, premium lager registered 2% growth in 2011. In addition, according to Euromonitor International, the category is forecast to grow at a 3% volume CAGR over 2011-2016 while standard lager is predicted a further 3% CAGR decline over the same period.</p>
<p>SABMiller is the least exposed of the top brewers to high-margin mature beer markets, thus growth of the premium segment and Foster's strong cash generation were the main factors attracting it to the Australian brewer. With the purchase, SABMiller has become the leading brewer in Australia with nearly a 50% share of total beer volumes, and it is getting ready to push its premium brands in the country to enhance its value generation, as it has done in other mature beer markets in Western Europe in recent years. In the past five years the company has significantly outperformed the wider market, for instance in the sluggish UK beer market by taking advantage of the growing popularity of premium lager and pushing its Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft and Pilsner Urquell brands. The company's premium-focused strategy has proved to be a great success. It managed to deliver subsequent double-digit volume growth and Peroni Nastro Azzurro became the best-selling imported premium lager brand in the country.</p>
<p>SABMiller has also been enjoying strong growth through its premium brands in Australia in the past couple of years. Its brands were distributed by its Pacific Beverages joint venture, although subsequent to the purchase of Foster's, the company will buy out Coca-Cola Amatil and all of its operations in Australia will be integrated into CUB. Through CUB, SABMiller will take advantage of a wider distribution network and the company might even switch to local production, although this could impact the image of some of its brands; for example, Peroni Nastro Azzurro relies heavily on its Italian heritage. Nevertheless, Japanese player Kirin Holdings, which currently leads the premium segment in Australia with a 34% volume share, slightly ahead of Foster's Group, will surely face increased competition from the London-based brewer.</p>
<p>Although Australia is a small beer market, accounting for less than 1% of global beer volumes in 2011, it does offer value growth potential through the premiumisation trend. Foster's Group was one of the last major acquisition targets in the highly consolidated global beer market, and as the company has been leaking market share in the last five years, it will be interesting to see whether SABMiller will be able to revive CUB and enhance its finances. </p>

Beer for Women: Clever Marketing or Just Insulting?,"Globally, retail volume sales of beer rose by 2% in 2011, marking something of a recovery following flat sales in 2009 and 2010. However, the situation may vary from country to country. In 2011, US beer volumes declined for a third consecutive year, falling by 2% to 23.5 billion litres. Value sales grew by a mere 1% to just over US$86 billion. Brewers have been able to maintain value sales growth despite volume declines through a focus on premium products and increases in unit price.","<p>Globally, retail volume sales of beer rose by 2% in 2011, marking something of a recovery following flat sales in 2009 and 2010.

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>At the same time, rising health awareness is leading to a shift towards lower ABV products, like wine, beer and cider. In terms of health claims, low calorie and low carbohydrate content are the primary trends driving such propositions, while attempts to promote functional attributes are still fairly sporadic, and products with such credentials account for only negligible volumes. However, such offerings seldom claim to promote health per se, but rather purport to moderate the negative effects of alcohol consumption. These products primarily target female consumers.</p>
<p>The rise in female employment, coupled with higher wages for women, has had a significant impact on purchasing power and spending habits, allowing women more discretionary income to spend on non-essentials or luxuries for their own personal wellbeing.</p>
<p>The recession, along with stronger female financial independence and stronger health awareness, has focused the attention of beer manufacturers on women. Beer taste and low carbohydrate content have not been the only features that manufacturers have considered as packaging is also starting to play a crucial role in this new positioning. However, this has led to questions being asked as to whether pink beer packaging has sexist implications?</p>
<p>One example of this female targeting is Chick Beer, launched in the US in the second half of 2011 by Chick Brewery Co. Chick Beer contains only 97 calories has a carbohydrate content of 3.5g per bottle and is a standard lager. The packaging is more interesting. The carton multipack looks like a purse and the glass bottle itself like a black cocktail dress. The colour scheme is pink and black. And this, apparently, is a cause of controversy. The marketing campaign, company website and beer packaging all reflect a certain stereotype of women in pink and probably with long legs and blonde hair. This clearly female-targeted product is unlikely to appeal to most women. However, the company believes that it will find followers and has responded to the critics by claiming that the beer industry as such is sexist as there are not that many beers produced specifically for women.</p>
<p>The fact that more women are choosing to enter higher education has played a big part in the rise in female employment the world over. This has also helped to do away with the 'pink blonde' stereotype and raise the level of equality between men and women. </p>
<p>Thus, it would appear that a more considered approach is required when marketing products for women. Women have become a more prospective consumer group through which to regain lost value share due to the recession. Thus, it is expected that the range of products specifically targeted at women will increase in all fmcg categories over the forecast period.</p>

<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>Key Trends</h3>
<h3>Micro-Breweries and Great expectations</h3>
<p>The story of the craft brewers' rise into the drinks limelight, in the face of chronically sliding beer volumes in the West, has already been discussed and reviewed repeatedly by industry observers. 2012 will see all the big manufacturers frantically revamp their offerings and aggressively flirt with small regional players in order to gain a foothold in what seems to be the only segment that completely ignores post and pre-recessionary fears in mature beer markets. </p>
<h3>Scent of a woman </h3>
<p>Female consumers have represented the alcoholic drinks industry's Holy Grail pretty much since the day the first random fermentation took place in a sealed clay urn somewhere in Mesopotamia. However, as stagnation and consumer retrenchment continues to bite in the vast majority of mature markets, the fairer sex will become even more of a priority for manufacturers and retailers alike looking for new lifeblood for the industry. </p>
<p>While this trend will be more or less applicable to spirits and wine as well, beer is the category that stands to witness the most innovative product launches and marketing campaigns for the benefit of the ever elusive female drinking segment. Since beer sales still disproportionally target male consumers in what is becoming an increasingly stagnant and mature market, this is not merely a choice anymore. It is a necessity. </p>
<h3>Cider</h3>
<h3>The apple of the industry's eye </h3>
<p>Cider sales will continue marching onwards and upwards, seemingly impervious to consumer austerity and belt tightening, governmental legislative offensives and demographic pressures. </p>
<p>Still primarily focusing on a very small number of markets, cider/perry should continue to navigate recent economic volatility on the back of a series of innovative product launches and a consistent push towards higher end varietals leveraging on heritage, provenance and tradition. </p>
<p>From the over-ice trend that revolutionised the category in 2005, to the fruit based concoctions that followed, to offerings that highlight local production or food pairing suggestions, cider/perry will retain an enviable trajectory relative to the rest of the alcoholic drinks industry. This is especially impressive given the fact that the vast majority of sales continue to be derived from largely mature markets.</p>
<h3>Companies to watch</h3>
<p>Since mergers and acquisitions marked the last decade, there are few acquisition targets left for beer companies. In 2011 major brewers continued to consolidate their global positions, SABMiller increased its exposure to high-margin markets with the acquisition of Australian Foster's Group, while Heineken further consolidated its position in Middle East and Africa with the purchase of breweries in Nigeria and Ethiopia. M&A activity however, is expected to be limited in 2012, brewers might bid for smaller third- or fourth-tier players to gain access to consolidated markets or enhance their distribution, but most players are likely to focus on organic growth.</p>
<p>As China is forecast to continue to lead global beer volume growth, Chinese players are expected to continue their dynamic growth, and they are worth watching, as in terms of volume, they might overtake international players in the global ranking in the coming years. Currently fifth- ranked China Resources is already threatening Carlsberg's position, which is struggling with falling beer volumes in its main Russian market. In 2011, Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewer in China, has announced that it is setting up a new brewery in Thailand, and the company is committed to expanding its presence globally, however its volumes are still concentrated in its domestic market, and as beer volumes in China are expected to continue to see robust growth, Chinese players are likely focus on capitalising on this instead of investing in international expansion. </p>
<p>Kirin Holdings is also likely to get more attention, following its latest entry in Brazil with the acquisition of Schincariol Participações e Representações SA. Many analysts believe that the Japanese brewer overpaid for the Brazilian company, which has weak operational efficiency and limited distribution in the country, thus Kirin will have to invest heavily to compete with the country's dominant player, A-B InBev. </p>
<p>Major brewers are expected to continue to focus on emerging markets; A-B InBev is likely to continue to push its brands in China, while SABMiller and Heineken can continue to take advantage of their increasing footprint in Middle East and Africa. Molson Coors and Diageo are also trying to catch up with competitors by increasing their presence in emerging markets. In 2011 Molson has taken controlling stake in Cobra India, while Diageo improved its position in the Middle East and Africa with further investments in Kenya and Tanzania, but they still have a lot to do to balance their geographic coverage.</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Although mature beer markets in North America and Western Europe are expected to remain sluggish, with their higher margins they remain important in value generation. As consumer behaviour changed in many markets with a growing interest in craft beers, brewers are trying to tap into this developing category. A-B InBev acquired a Chicago-based craft brewer, Goose Island, and Molson Coors took over Sharp Brewery in the UK. Cider/perry also has a similar appeal to craft beer, and has shown growing popularity, thus it can offer growth opportunity for companies. Heineken leads the category, and competes with many small local players, but competition is expected to intensify as A-B InBev has launched its first cider brand, Stella Artois Cidre in the UK, and is likely to try to take the brand to global scale. Since the cider/perry market is quite fragmented, brewers might look for acquisition targets in this category to further strengthen their global positions.</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>Beer brands to watch</h3>
<p>Budweiser is a brand that is worth continuing to watch, since A-B InBev is pushing the brand in high-growth markets, such as Brazil and China to offset declines in the brand's main US market. Carlsberg can also be interesting, since the company has repositioned its namesake brand, emphasising its premium quality.  Premiumisation remains a major trend, and brewers are expected to continue to try to take advantage of the premium growth with innovations. In 2011 Molson Coors has launched Carling Chrome a premium variant of Carling in the UK, while A-B InBev is extending its portfolio with Bud Light Platinum in the US. Heineken will continue to focus on its premium Heineken brand, and support it with extensive marketing, but the company is also expected to increase investment in its recently acquired Mexican brands in many of its key markets to compete against Grupo Modelo's Corona Extra. </p>

Why Diageo Will Not and Should Not Sell its Beer Operations,"Over the past few years a number of people have suggested that Diageo should divest its beer operations and use the money raised (around £6 billion) to strengthen its spirits business. While there is a case to be made for the company to do so, this scenario is both unlikely and would be unwise in the short to medium term. ","<p>Over the past few years a number of people have suggested that Diageo should divest its beer operations and use the money raised (around £6 billion) to strengthen its spirits business. While there is a case to be made for the company to do so, this scenario is both unlikely and would be unwise in the short to medium term. </p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<p>Diageo in beer is, and will increasingly become, a regional brewer, with its volumes increasingly focused on the Middle East and Africa. In 2011, the region accounted for 65% of the company's beer volumes, up from 53% in 2006. </p>
<p>The company's presence outside the region is based on the Guinness brand, and while the brand has a strong international image volumes sales in its major markets of the UK and Ireland are declining. Diageo's shrinking volumes outside the region and the highly consolidated nature of the global beer market mean it will only be a regional player. Consequently, why waste resources on being just a regional player in that category when it could use the resources for further development in spirits in which it is one of the world's leading players?</p>
<p>In terms of companies which could possibly afford Diageo's beer operations, both SABMiller and Heineken are likely to be restricted by antitrust issues and so the only realistic option would be A-B InBev, which is very weak in the Middle East and Africa. Carlsberg is also weak in the region and would greatly benefit from such an acquisition. Unfortunately, with revenues of £6.8 billion in 2010, the price tag would be a struggle for Carlsberg.</p>
<h3>Why Diageo will not sell</h3>
<p>In 2011, Diageo set itself the target of trying to generate 50% of its revenue from emerging markets by 2015, up from 34% in fiscal 2011. Beer, with its strong and growing presence in Africa, will be key to reaching that target, with beer in the Middle East and Africa expected to post a 5% volume CAGR (3.8 billion litres) over 2011-2016, with many markets in which Diageo is present (Nigeria) being key growth areas in the region.</p>
<p>This is something that the company has recognised, as witnessed by the large sums of money it has invested in African beer in terms of acquisitions (in Ethiopia and Tanzania) and expanding its brewing capacity (Nigeria).</p>
<p>Selling its beer operations would significantly reduce Diageo's chances of reaching that target. According to Euromonitor International data, 65% of the company's (higher value) spirits volumes derive from mature markets compared to 58% of its total volumes (by litres of pure alcohol) at overall alcoholic drinks level, thanks primarily to its African beer operations. </p>
<h3>Why Diageo should not sell</h3>
<p>In addition to providing a great way of developing its emerging market revenues, its beer operations provide good routes to market for its higher-margin spirits and RTD brands, both of which are starting to take off, particularly in key Diageo markets such as Nigeria where consumers are increasingly able to trade up to more premium international products. Blended Scotch is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR (20 million litres) over 2011-2016. </p>
<p>There is also the issue as to what Diageo would spend the money on. It could use it to reduce its debt burden so that it is negligible, but its debts are currently manageable and with strong revenues, thanks in part to its beer portfolio in Africa, can be paid down relatively easily.</p>
<p>In terms of acquisitions, it can already afford to acquire José Cuervo if its owner sells, while larger deals such as acquiring the remaining stake in Moët Hennessy or a stake in United Spirits seem very unlikely at the moment. The only possible acquisition that is available, Beam, would not help its emerging market profile. Assuming it continues its relationship with Cuervo in some form, acquiring other major brands would run into antitrust issues in one form or another.</p>
<p>This could all change if the company is faced with the opportunity of making a number of major emerging market acquisitions in spirits, such as those mentioned above, in a short space of time. Even then, Diageo may well be reluctant to do so due to the strong routes to market beer offers. Instead, it could well be more willing to allow a company such as A-B InBev to buy an equity stake in its operations, just as SABMiller has done with Castel. </p>

Beer in Russia: The Kremlin’s Suffocating Embrace,"It has been less than two years since Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev declared war on the alcoholic 'scourge' gripping Russia.

Following the introduction of a punitive 200% tax hike on beer and a debate involving intricate political manoeuvring, last ditch lobbying attempts and some rather dramatic volatility in the share prices of leading brewers in the country, the new 'lighter' version of the latest round of legislative amendments was eventually voted in by the State Duma at the end of July 2011. As the effects of the recent statutory offensive are still under intense scrutiny as previous attempts to curb consumption achieved dubious results at best, Euromonitor International looks into this latest in the series of unfortunate events impacting beer sales in Russia.</p>
<div class=""jump_break"" contenteditable=""false"" unselectable=""on""></div>
<h3>The rise of neo-prohibitionary rhetoric </h3>
<p>Firstly, it is worth acknowledging the surprising resilience of the Russian beer market. It has been an uphill battle all along but the last couple of years put international brewers on a direct collision course with the inhabitants of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>A beer consumption culture was not at all developed in the USSR. However, with the advent of major international companies in the Russian beer market, consumption increased four-fold over the 1997-2007 period. And then came the legislative sea change. The bill tripling the excise tax rate on beer was passed in late 2009 and came into effect in January 2010. At the same time, the legislators decided to leave the excise tax rate on spirits with an alcohol content of above 9% unchanged until 2012.</p>
<p>The unprecedented increase could not but be reflected in the unit price of beer and expectations surrounding the market's knee-jerk reaction ranged from the sobering to the apocalyptic. In hindsight, over-pessimistic projections proved to be exactly that. Overall beer volumes in the country did witness a significant 5% drop but a double-digit collapse was easily averted, partly due to the abnormally hot weather of 2010 which provided a counterbalancing boost to the category. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, just as the beer market was starting to recover from the shock, the Kremlin decided to stem impulse buying. </p>
<h3>No reason to panic</h3>
<p>Initial drafts of the latest bill were much more hard line than the version eventually approved. Proposals included the introduction of additional licensing for beer production and compulsory excise stamps, a ban on PET bottles, a ban on selling beer in non-stationary retail outlets (kiosks), a ban on selling any alcoholic drinks (including beer) from 23.00-08.00hrs in off-trade channels, a ban on drinking alcoholic drinks (including beer) in public places and an attempt to reduce the number of beer advertising channels.</p>
<p>Discussion of the bill proved to be a painfully slow process, dragging on for more than six months. During that period brewers aggressively defended their corner. Moreover, expecting new restrictions on their products' promotion in the near future, they opted to dramatically increase their advertising budgets in 2011.</p>
<p>Following much deliberation, President Dmitry Medvedev signed the law ""On state regulation of production and turnover of ethyl alcohol and alcohol products"" in July 2011. The final signed version of the law was thankfully 'lighter' than first suggested. </p>
<p>The new bill does indeed deliver a complete ban on the retail sale of all types of alcohol, including beer, between 23.00-08.00hrs from January 2013. Additionally, the retail sale of beer in kiosks and pavilions, as well as at bus stops, open markets, railway stations, petrol stations and airports, will be prohibited at any time. On the other hand, the PET ban did not survive the vote while brewers had enough time to revamp their distribution networks and reassess their strategies, avoiding a sudden and potentially catastrophic shift in their operational models. </p>
<p>How will these legislative changes impact drinking habits and consumption patterns? Limiting selling hours will merely force Russian beer drinkers to buy in advance. However, at the end of the day, beer will still be available in the on-trade at any time. </p>
<p>The ban on consumption of beer in public places along with the ban on sales in non-stationary retail outlets (kiosks) will essentially eliminate the country's buoyant on-the-go beer consumption culture and will hence become the most painful thorn in the industry's side. Additionally, it will reduce beer consumption in regions with underdeveloped retail and potentially cut down the number of kiosks in large cities as beer accounts for the key share of their turnover. On the other hand, the new restrictions on promotion and advertising will not have a negative impact on the Russian beer market size, but rather tie the hands of leading players in their feverish attempts to gain share. </p>
<p>Initial estimates regarding projected growth rates suggest that while beer is back on a healthy footing in 2011, growth rates will indeed witness a slowdown again in 2012 and 2013 – without entering negative territory - as the new law starts to be implemented. On the other hand, and beyond this latest blip, the long-term prospects remain decidedly optimistic. The Russian alcoholic drinks market has been through tough times before and will overcome this latest legislative offensive the same way it did previous ones. </p>

Casella Wines Enters the Australian Beer Market,"Australian wine maker Casella Wines has announced that it is entering the beer category in its domestic market. With the entry the company is aiming to diversify its Australian business as wine sales have been hit by falling demand and oversupply in recent years.

<h3>Struggling wine sales</h3>
<p>Although Casella's wine volumes have been steadily growing in its largest US market over the past five years, the company has been facing oversupply and significant discounting in its domestic Australian market, which has hit its profitability. In 2011, according to Euromonitor International's estimates, Casella's volume sales declined by more than 6% in the country, and, as the market is forecast to remain broadly flat, competition is expected to remain stiff and growth prospects are likely to be limited. </p>
<p>Due to the difficult conditions other major wine companies have already tried to restructure their businesses in Australia. Leading player Constellation Brands withdrew from Australia in 2011, selling its Australian operations to CHAMP Private Equity (later re-branded as Accolade Wines), while third-ranked Treasury Wine Estates withdrew its low-margin brands and divested several vineyards. While most other wine companies have tried to streamline their businesses to focus on more profitable channels and products, Casella has decided to diversify its business by entering the beer market.</p>
<h3>Tapping into the growing demand for premium lager</h3>
<p>The Australian beer market is quite mature and demand for beer has been declining in recent years, mainly due to increasing health concerns and the growing popularity of other alcoholic beverages, such as spirits, RTDS/high-strength premixes and cider/perry. However, while overall beer consumption has declined, there has been a strong premiumisation trend as consumers have been looking for authentic and higher-quality products. According to Euromonitor International estimates, in 2011 total beer volumes declined by nearly 4% in the country, but premium lager registered nearly 2% growth compared to the previous year. This trend is expected to continue and the category is predicted to outperform the wider beer market with a 3% volume CAGR over 2011-2016.</p>
<p>Casella aims to tap into this growing premium segment through the launch of a premium lager called Arvo. The company has built a brewery at the family winery in Yenda in New South Wales with a production capacity of 35,000 bottles of beer an hour, and it has hired former SABMiller brewer Andy Mitchell as lead brew master. The company has invested significant amounts in market research and launched its 'Perfect Lager Project' in April to find out what consumers want so it can create an Australian premium beer that can compete with international brands. </p>
<p>The company has quite ambitious expectations, and it claims that by using the full capacity of its plant it can achieve 7% of Australia's beer market. Moreover, the company already has plans for international expansion. Although Arvo was primarily created for the Australian market, Casella is looking to achieve the same success with the brand's export as it did with its main Yellow Tail wine label.</p>
<h3>Strong competition</h3>
<p>Casella can take advantage of its well-established presence and distribution in Australia, and might be able to benefit from cross promoting beer and wine, but it is likely to face stiff competition from the leading international players. SABMiller, the second largest global brewer, became the leading player in Australia with a 47% share of total volumes in 2011 following its acquisition of Foster's Group. Although the company has lost several licence agreements to its main rival Lion in 2012 (such as Corona Extra, Guinness, Stella Artois), it is committed to enhancing its position in the premium segment and is expected to push its key international brands, such as Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Miller Genuine Draft. Japanese player Kirin Holdings, which has owned Lion since 2009, has also been working on expanding its presence in the country, and announced earlier in June 2012 that it has agreed to fully acquire Little World Beverages to enhance its position in the craft beer category.</p>
<p>Arvo, with an emphasis on its Australian origins, could be successful, but due to the high level of consolidation, strong competitors and well-established brands, Casella will have to invest to promote the brand in order to grasp a major share of the market. </p>
